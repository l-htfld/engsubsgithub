know about that those things don't happen every day i beg your pardon what would you do if the ghost of a famous movie star appeared in front of you right now well uh i'd ask about her life her career and then i'd get her phone number tom i'm serious it wouldn't make one hell of an article though yeah i hadn't thought of that yeah sure imagine what it would be like to interview a ghost say the ghost of napoleon einstein or hitler well maybe not hitler but you get my drift i sure do but of course um we can't talk to the dead music no of course not it'd be nice if we could but we don't we

to you that night right i'm gonna need some background billy i would like to interview you for hollywood beat really what's hollywood beat it's kind of a fan magazine oh they used to write about me all the time hey this isn't some kind of a joke is it crossed my heart and hoped it honest oh this is going to be just crazy like the good old days when do we get started i was in this hotel on the riviera locked out on the balcony with nothing on but my goodwill i climbed onto the balcony next door and ran into this simply creamy banker smack in the middle of the wall street journal boy was he

dead that almost sounded profound so what about you who is that guy who is here before you mean tom he's just someone i met so do you like him i don't know maybe angie either you do or you don't so what if i do well you might show it a little just because i like guy doesn't mean i have to throw myself at him who said anything about throwing yourself at him if you play it right i'll jump you billy it's almost . women are different today hey you want to go for a walk billy how did you you know what i i know it wasn't suicide was it hey i didn't mean to upset you i just want to know music i wish i could tell you well if you don't want to talk about it believe me i'll understand no it's not that you see i've tried and tried to remember what happened that night it just it just keeps coming

least it's better than nothing music billy billy billy think you are i was wondering where you'd gone come on over here take a look at what i've written so far music billy billy come back music sorry excuse me billy blaine in her own words what happened to chuck aaron's story i got a little sidetracked wow that's completely irresponsible i mean i'm putting this new issue to press tonight angela how could you do this to me just put billy blaine in place of rambo jr she's a lot more interesting believe me she has been dead for more than years i know that i ran across an old diary of hers in the house i'm staying at an old diary you know this whole thing is starting to sound like something out of nancy drew are you feeling all right does it sound like it i'll be back in a minute so what did you think of our story what are you doing here i wanted to come along i haven't been anywhere since . you haven't no every time i tried to leave the house it felt like someone nailed my shoes to the floor but when i'm with you it's different i just got in the car and came along that's nice billy but you can't stay somebody is gonna see you oh no no one can see me unless i want them to right now you're the only one who can oh well just keep it that way and don't say anything either okay okay angela are you talking to yourself no i was talking to my imaginary playmate baxter say hello oh nice to see you pal putting on a little weight aren't you oh rude why i never so um what about the piece angela sweetheart this blame name is old news she's history i am not she's more than history she's a hollywood legend yes think about it baxter you could be the first to publish her long lost autobiography which you just happened to find after all these years oh come on there's something fishy about this whole thing besides nobody is interested in reading crap like that music crap no angela you can't let him treat you like that music baxter you can't treat me like that what you can take hollywood beat and stick it that's telling him if you're not interested in the article there are many other magazines who will be so put that in your pipe and smoke it buster oh come on you wouldn't do that to me try me yeah try it all right all right all right sit down will you please we can talk about this so you'll do it as a series maybe all right at double the normal rate hey you're pretty sharp that well i don't have money like that no problem all right all right all right okay well you drive a hard bargain there you go this should fit right in the spot you save for the chuck aaron peace see you next issue music oh my god i gotta teach you not to talk that way about a lake just get away get just get away please look at this it becomes you music really the new issue of hollywood beat is here well let me see whoa a cover story baxter billy blaine in her own words by angela reed with an uncredited assist from me pretty good for a ghost writer yeah can i read it first please sure go ahead hello miss reed yes i was told i could reach you there i just finished your article in hollywood beat music what about it i'm very interested in purchasing the diary of billy blaine i'm sorry but it's not for sale who is this miss reed i'm sure you know perfectly well who this is i'm also sure that you know that i'd be willing to pay handsomely for it this is murray over at tinseltown isn't it my offer is for you to drop your story and hand over the diary hey look i don't know what magazine you're with but in any case my answer is no well i'm sorry you don't want to cooperate miss reed nevertheless i am going to get that diary it just would have been so much simpler for you this way music well looks like we're going to have to do things the old fashioned way who is that on the phone i don't know probably just a crank call hey i've got an idea why don't we go out to a club tonight do you mean it sure the first installment's already out the second one isn't due for a couple of weeks we owe ourselves a break ah that would be just swell i wonder what i should wear well what do you think music i think it would be great if we were going to the academy awards is it really too much or too little depending on how you look at it well i really don't know what's in fashion these days oh don't worry about it billy besides no one can see you let's just go out there and have a great time i can't if i look yucky trust me you don't look yucky music she's talking to herself so what you talk to yourself oh i don't you should do it i do not music hey she's taking off

here by myself yeah just call me a two fisted drinker cool you mind if i sit down no i really would be i've been thinking about that letter you got you know the one from billy blaine i think she was trying to make contact with you oh yeah oh no doubt about it but i got this idea you see what if you were to hook up your typewriter to a ouija board then you you could ask her things and the ouija board could type out the answers how would you hook the two together i don't know i haven't figured that part out yet maybe uh if you uh well if you hooked it up to a lightning round and and held the seance during the storm that would never work it never rains in california so how do you like this place would you just excuse me for a minute um nice guns music check this out already or what no

everyone to think she can write still you understand what's wrong oh nothing nothing at all ah tom you don't think i'm making this up do you i don't know what to think you're a very pretty girl and a good kisser but if you think you're seeing ghosts you need something other than a boyfriend but tom i swear and if if you're making this up just to break the mood it'd be a lot simpler just to tell me

what i thought you said applause music for somebody you mean by your dead music applause tom tom hello we have your friend miss reed the man you spent last night with i'm willing to trade his life in the diary you have wait a minute who is this the time for games is long past must read i'll give you one hour to decide and i wouldn't call the authorities if i were you at the first sign of police your friend is a dead man where is she where's who billy blaine but she's not here oh then you don't deny that she was here just like you don't deny that i saw you the other night with her at scream yes yes it was her so where is she back in ghostland how would i know look i can't worry about her now tom has been kidnapped oh no who's tom thank you angela think they said they'd kill tom if i didn't give him the diary so why don't you just give him the diary because i don't have it it doesn't even exist billy was telling me her life story i was writing it we had to explain where it was coming from so we made up the diary whoever kidnapped tom must think that billy had written something incriminating about him it's got to be someone she knows bj you've got to help me call her back me yeah she's she's kind of mad at me right now and since you're such a big fan if you called her maybe she'd come back well all right but i i just feel really kind of silly doing this uh billy billy blaine yo billy can i get an autograph certainly bj anything you want really i'm so glad you're here i'm not speaking to you music so bj what would you like me to sign billy i apologize for what i said last night i really do but you've got to help me tom has been kidnapped oh no who's tom by whom well that's what i don't know it has to be someone from your past someone who wouldn't want your memoirs published gosh that could be a hundred different guys and it has to be someone who wasn't mentioned in the first article does that help i don't know were there any married men no but there was this one guy i dated secretly i think he had mob connections so we never met in public it was always here or some secluded place good good do you remember his name vinny vinnie carbone vincent carbone the politician he's running for the senate no kidding i always knew he was ambitious wait a minute it couldn't be vinnie why not we were going to get married we were going to announce it to the public and everything in fact he proposed to me the night i drowned you never mentioned that before i just remembered i wonder why carbon why does that name sound familiar why does that name sound so familiar you probably heard it on the news no no no no what's this it's from a paper it's uh billy blaine's uh a death notice it's a pretty ghoulish thing to carry around isn't it i think it's sweet now here it is right on the back here carbon appointed to mayor's staff vincent carbone attended ceremonies at city hall accompanied by his wife dorothy his wife what you mean he was already married jesus billy do you know what this means yeah i sure do means he was a no good two timing bum it was a lot worse than that don't you see he couldn't marry you he already had a wife his political career was just starting out he didn't come here that night to propose he must have slipped an overdose of barbiturates into your drink and then he let the tide do the rest holy guess i never did have too much luck with men five husbands five divorces then the last guy decides to kill me before he even said i do lily honey i know this isn't easy for you but this guy murdered once to prevent a scandal and he'll do it again music even if i did have the diary to give to him he'd never let tom or me go free music please you've got to help us what do you want me to do we've got to shift the odds over to our side count me in pj you mean it sure thing let's nail this butthole music she's clean right this way music billy billy are you still here i'm right here oh good listen i know how hard it's going to be for you to control your temper when you see him please just try to remember tom's life is at stake here don't you worry angie well well miss reed nice to meet you face to face i'm sorry i can't say the same thing oh come on now you can't allow yourself to take these things personally may i pour you a drink no thank you no well i hope you don't mind if i have one to think i used to be in love with him so miss reed i trust you brought the diary with you no i didn't why not because mr carbone once you have it what's to stop you from killing us both laughter you must think i'm quite a desperate character don't you you have an affair with a movie star then fake her suicide to protect your career now you're trying to prevent your past from being dredged up before the election i'd say you're living slime don't look misread please please don't take these things personally not quite right after all this is strictly business isn't it you know that's something billy would never have understood oh spare me i wanted to tell her i was married that it would never work out between us but the girl was crazy about me don't flatter yourself she demanded more and more of my time she never got enough of me i think i'm going to throw up billy oh yes billy um you know i really think i did her a favor when i slipped to those pills a girl never could have lived without me why you dirty oh
