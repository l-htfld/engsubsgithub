your poisonous words! why did you come to me?you're not some middle class banker who wants elocution lessonsso you can chitchat. don't attempt to instruct meon my duties! i am the son of a. king. and the brother of. of a king. you're the disappointing sonof a brewer. a jumped up jackeroo from the outback. you're a nobody.these sessions are over. man through here, sir. man it's not because she's anamerican. that is the least of it. it's because she's a soonto be twice divorced american. and the king,as head of the church of england, cannot marry a divorced woman. and, sir, i apologizefor the nature of this. according to scotland yard, the king has not alwayspossessed exclusive rights to mrs. simpson's.favors and affections. .sharing them with amarried used car salesman, a certain mr. guy trundle. coughs in addition, it is alsorumored hitler's ambassador, count von ribbentrop,sends her carnations every day. should his majesty continue to ignorethe advice of his government, he must abdicate. otherwise, his governmenthas no choice but to resign. prime minister,you'd leave a country without a. .a government? does the king do what he wants? or does he do whatthe people expect him to do? man on radio as crowds in downingstreet watch ministers come and go, there is raised an age old problem can a king separate his personal life from his public duty. what's the matter, love? i'm just having trouble with a patient. myrtle that isn't like you. why? he's scared. he's afraid of his own shadow. isn't that why they come to you? this fellow couldreally be somebody great. he's fighting me. perhaps he doesn't want to be great. perhaps that's what you want. i might have overstepped the mark. apologize. do you both good. footsteps approaching i'm very sorry, mr. logue,the duke is busy. i'm happy to wait.or i could come back later. as i said, the duke is terribly busy. door opens thank you. parliament will not supportthe marriage. but there are other reasons for concern. he was careless with state papers.he lacked commitment and resolve, and there are those who areworried about where he will stand when war comes with germany. we're not coming to that? indeed we are, sir. prime minister baldwin may deny this,but hitler's intent is crystal clear. war with germany will come. and we will need a kingwhom we can all stand behind, united. i fear my. .brother is not of sound mind. .at this time. have you thoughtwhat you will call yourself? hmm? struggles to speak certainly not albert, sir.too germanic. chuckles stammering what about george?after your father? george the sixthhas a rather nice continuity to it. don't you think? david. thank god. door shuts you look exhausted. how are you bearing up? bertie, the decision's been made. i. i'm going. i can't accept that. i'm afraid there's no other way. i must marry her. my mind's made up. i'm. sorry. that's a terrible thing to hear. nobody wants that. i, least of all. david on radio at long last, i am able to say a few words of my own. i have never wantedto withhold anything, but until now it has not beenconstitutionally possible for me to speak. a few hours ago,i discharged my last duty as king and emperor, and now that i have been succeededby my brother, the duke of york, my first words must beto declare my allegiance to him. this i do with all my heart. you all know the reasons which haveimpelled me to renounce the throne, but you must believe me when i tell you that i have found it impossibleto carry the heavy burden of responsibilityand to discharge my duties as king, as i would wish to do without the help and supportof the woman i love. continuing on radio and i want you to know, this decision has beenmade less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long trainingin the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities, will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire. bell chimes doors shut i meet you today. .in. .in circumstances which are. struggling to speak elizabeth i'm sure you'll love it. margaret there you go. thank you, darling.saddles. margaret. there's montezuma. oh, here's one. mama, here's a horse and saddle. thank you. oops. don't worry, sally. we'll get you. mama?

precisely. he's not here anymore. yes, he is.he's on that shilling i gave you. chuckles easy enough to give away. you don't have to carry himaround in your pocket. or your brother. you don't need to be afraidof the things you were afraid of when you were five. sighs you're very much your own man, bertie. am i?

now, allow me to guide youthrough the ceremony. we begin, of course,at the west door into the nave. i see all your pronouncementsare to be broadcast, archbishop. ah, yes. wireless. it is, indeed, a pandora's box, and i'm afraid i've also hadto permit the newsreel cameras. the product of whichi shall personally edit. without momentary hesitations. this is dr. logue of harley street. he's. my speech therapist. your grace. had i known that your majesty was seeking assistance, i shouldhave made my own recommendation. dr. logue will. .will be attending the coronation. of course i'll speak to the dean,but it will be extremely difficult. i should like the. .doctor to be seated in the. .king's box. archbishop but members of your familywill be seated there, sir. that is why it is suitable. and now, if you don't mind, your grace,we need the premises. my dear fellow,this is westminster abbey. the church must prepare his majesty. my preparations are equallyas important. with complete privacy,if you don't mind. those are my wishes, your grace. i will place the abbeyat your majesty's disposal, this evening. your majesty. indistinct murmuring i can't believe i'm walkingon chaucer and handel and dickens. everything all right?let's get cracking. i'm not here to rehearse, dr. logue. call me lionel. true, you. never. .called yourself doctor. i did that. .for you. no training. no diploma, no. .qualifications. just. a great deal of nerve. the star chamber inquisition, is it? you asked for trust. and. total equality. bertie, i heard you at wembley.i was there. my son laurie said, dad, do you thinkyou could help that poor man? what, as a failed actor? it's true. i'm not a doctor.and yes, i acted, a bit. well, i recited in pubs.i taught elocution in schools. when the great war came, all our soldiers were returningto australia from the front, a lot of them shell shocked,unable to speak. somebody said, lionel, you're very good at this speech stuff. do you think you could possiblyhelp these poor buggers? i did muscle therapy,exercises, relaxation, but i knew i had to go deeper. those poor young blokeshad cried out in fear. no one was listening to them. my job was to give them faithin their own voice, and let them know thata friend was listening. that must ringa few bells with you, bertie. you give a very nobleaccount of yourself. make inquiries. it's all true. inquiries have been made. you have no idea who i havebreathing down my neck. i vouched for you, and you have no. .credentials. but lots of success. i can't show you a certificate.there was no training then. everything i know,i know from experience. and that war was some experience. my plaque says, l. logue, speech defects. not doctor. there are no letters after my name. lock me in the tower. i would if i could. on what charge? fraud. with war looming, you've saddledthis nation with a voiceless. .king. you've destroyedthe happiness of my family, all for the sake of ensnaringa star. patient you couldn't. .possibly hope to assist. it'll be like mad. .king george the third. i'll be. mad king. .george the stammerer. .who let his people downso badly in their hour of need. what are you doing? get up!you can't sit there! get up! why not? it's a chair. no, it. that is not a chair! that is. that. that is saint edward's chair. people have carved their names on it. that chair is the seaton which every king. it's held in place by a large rock. that is the stone of scone! you are trivializing everything. i don't care how many royal assholes .have sat on this chair. listen to me! listen to me! listen to you? by what right? by divine right, if you must. i am your king! no, you're not. you told me so yourself.you said you didn't want it. why should i waste my timelistening to you? because i have a right to be heard!i have a voice! yes, you do. you have such perseverance, bertie.you're the bravest man i know. you'll make a bloody good king. what on earth is going on, sir? it's quite all right, archbishop. mr. logue, you must know that i've found a replacement englishspecialist with impeccable credentials. hence, your serviceswill no longer be required. i'm sorry? your majesty's function is to consult and be advised.now, you didn't consult, .but you have just been advised. and now i advise you. in this personal matter,i will make my own decision. my concern is for the headon which i must place the crown. i appreciate that, archbishop. but it's my head. your humble servant. thank you, bertie. shall we rehearse? come on.up on your perch. now, when you and elizabethenter through the west door, you will be greeted by the hymn i was glad when they said unto me. actually, you won't be that glad becausethey do sing it for a very long time. then your friend, the archbishop,will ponce up the stairs towards you, and say, sir, is your majestywilling to take the oath? i am willing. well, of course you are. i'm gonna see what this sounds likein the cheap seats, so even your old nanny can hear. will you govern your peoples,great britain, ireland, canada, australia and new zealand, according to their lands and customs? i solemnly promise to do so! louder. i can't hear you up the back. i solemnly promise to do so. very good. and will you, to your power, cause law and justice, in mercy to beexecuted in all your judgments? i will. louder i will! then there's a very long bitabout upholding the faith. it goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,to which you finally say. the things which i have.here before promised, i will perform and keep.so help me god. and that's all you say.four short responses. kiss the book, sign the oath,and you're king. easy. man on film speaks indistinctly you nearly crowned him backwards,archbishop. someone had removed the threadmarking the back of the crown, sir. try not to lose the thread, archbishop. chuckles archbishop, we're missing papa. all god save the king. very good. very good, archbishop. well, i hope your majestiesare thrilled with the result. you can switch that machine off. no, wait. keep going. nazism has held its great convention. do take a seat, archbishop. masses of uniformed men,stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imaginationhave stood in spellbound audience. .of the fuhrer. speaking german papao papa, what's he saying?

can i. can i form a government? can i. can i. levy a tax? declare a. a war? no. and yet i'm the seat of all authority.why? because. .the nation believesthat when i. i speak, i speak for them. but i can't speak. let's take it all again from the top. in this grave hour. clears throat in this grave hour.fuck, fuck, fuck. perhaps the most fatefulin our history. bugger, shit, shit. i send to every household of my. you see, p is always difficult,even when i'm singing. bounce on to it. a peoples. a people. a people. household of my peoples,both at home .and overseas. beautiful. this message. doo dah spoken with the same depth of feeling,doo dah day, .for each one of you,as if i were able to. shit, fuck, bugger! .cross yourthreshold and speak to you. in your head now. i have a rightto be bloody well heard. bloody well heard,bloody well heard myself! now, waltz. move.get continuous movement. for the second timein the lives of most of us. we are at. lionel we are, take a pause. lionel, i can't do this. bertie, you can do it. have a look at the last paragraph. bertie. it's time. indistinct chattering there he is. dog barks archbishop. your majesty. a great moment, sir. prime minister. your majesty. nice to see you. again so soon. good of you to be here.i'm sure you have had. .a rather busy day. i hope we have no more interruptions. .from those damn sirens, sir. or the wretched dogs. congrat. congratulations. first lord of the admiralty. your majesty. the long. walk. good luck, sir. i, too, dread this apparatus. had a speech impediment myself,you know. i didn't. family secret. tongue tied. an operation was consideredto be too dangerous. i eventually made an asset of it. chuckles thank you, mr. churchill. sir. darling. how long, logue?
