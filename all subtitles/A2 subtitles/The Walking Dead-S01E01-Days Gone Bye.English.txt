man this a joke? no, i'm serious. man i never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light. they're born thinking the switch only goes one way on. mutters they're struck blind the second they leave a room. i mean every woman i ever let have a key i swear to god, it's like i come home, house all lit up. chuckles and my job, you see, apparently because my chromosomes happen to be different is i've then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on. is that right? yeah, baby. mmm. oh, reverend shane is preaching to you now, boy. both laugh then the same chick, mind you she'll bitch about global warming. you see, this is this is when reverend shane wants to quote from the guy gospel and say, darling, maybe you and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figure out the light switch, you see, goes both ways, maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming. you know? you say that? mmm. yeah, well, a polite version. laughs still, man, that earns me this look of loathing you would not believe. and that's when the exorcist voice pops out. deep voice you sound just like my damn father! always yelling about the power bill, telling me to turn off the damn lights! and what do you say to that? i know what i want to say. i want to say, bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch? both laugh you know, i i don't actually say that though. that would be bad. right right. yeah, i go with the i go with the polite version there too. very wise. yes sir. mm hmm. well. so how's it with lori, man?

do you share your feelings, that kind of stuff? the thing is lately, whenever i try, everything i say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all. it's like she's. pissed at me all the time and i don't know why. look, man. that's just shit couples go through. yeah, it's a phase. the last thing she said this morning, sometimes i wonder if you even care about us at all. she said that in front of our kid. imagine going to school with that in your head. the difference between men and women?
