flixify.app female voice the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth. i smell it in the air. much that once was. .is lost. for none now live who remember it. it began with the forgingof the great rings. three were given to the elves immortal, wisest and fairestof all beings. seven to the dwarf lords great miners and craftsmenof the mountain halls. and nine. .nine rings were giftedto the race of men. .who, above all else, desire power. for within these rings was boundthe strength and will to govern each race. but they were all of them deceived. for another ring was made. in the land of mordor,in the fires of mount doom. .the dark lord sauron forgedin secret a master ring. .to control all others. and into this ring he pouredhis cruelty, his malice. .and his will to dominate all life. one ring to rule them all. one by one. .the free lands of middle earthfell to the power of the ring. but there were some who resisted. a last alliance of men and elvesmarched against the armies of mordor. and on the slopes of mount doom, theyfought for the freedom of middle earth. victory was near. but the power of the ring. .could not be undone. it was in this moment. .when all hope had faded. .that lsildur, son of the king,took up his father's sword. sauron, the enemy of the free peoplesof middle earth, was defeated. the ring passed to lsildur. .who had this one chanceto destroy evil forever. but the hearts of men. .are easily corrupted. and the ring of powerhas a will of its own. it betrayed lsildur. . .to his death. and some thingsthat should not have been forgotten. .were lost. history became legend. .legend became myth. and fortwo and a half thousand years. .the ring passedout of all knowledge. until, when chance came. .it ensnared a new bearer. gollum my precious. female voice the ring cameto the creature gollum. .who took it deep into the tunnelsof the misty mountains. and there it consumed him. gollum it came to me. my own. my love. my own. my precious. female voice the ring broughtto gollum unnatural long life. for years it poisoned his mind. and in the gloom of gollum's cave,it waited. darkness crept backinto the forests of the world. rumor grew of a shadow in the east. .whispers of a nameless fear. and the ring of power perceived. .its time had now come. it abandoned gollum. but something happened thenthe ring did not intend. it was picked up by the most unlikelycreature imaginable. bilbo what's this? female voice a hobbit. bilbo baggins of the shire. a ring. gollum lost! my precious is lost! female voice for the time will soon come. .when hobbits will shapethe fortunes of all. bilbo the nd day of september. .in the year . .by shire reckoning. bag end, bagshot row, hobbiton,westfarthing. .the shire. .middle earth. the third age of this world. there and back again a hobbit's tale. by bilbo baggins. now. .where to begin? ah, yes. concerning. .hobbits. hobbits have been living and farmingin the four farthings of the shire. .for many hundreds of years. .quite content to ignoreand be ignored. .by the world of the big folk. middle earth being, after all,full of strange creatures beyond count. .hobbits must seemof little importance. .being neither renownedas great warriors. .nor counted among the very wise. frodo! someone at the door. in fact, it has been remarked by some. .that hobbits' only real passionis for food. a rather unfair observation. .as we have also developed a keeninterest in the brewing of ales. .and the smoking of pipe weed. but where our hearts truly lie. .is in peace and quiet. .and good, tilled earth. for all hobbits share a loveof things that grow. and, yes, no doubt to others,our ways seem quaint. but today of all days,it is brought home to me it is no bad thingto celebrate a simple life. frodo, the door! sticklebacks. where is that boy? frodo! male voice down from the door where it began and i must follow if i can the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can you're late. a wizard is never late, frodo baggins. nor is he early. he arrivesprecisely when he means to. it's wonderful to see you, gandalf! you didn't think i'd missyour uncle bilbo's birthday?

i haven't been dropping no eaves. honest.i was cutting the grass under the window. a little late for trimming the verge,don't you think? i heard raised voices. what did you hear? speak! nothing important. that is, i heard a good deal about a ring,a dark lord and the end of the world but please, mr. gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.don't turn me into anything unnatural. no? perhaps not. i've thought of a better use for you. gandalf come along, samwise. keep up. be careful, both of you. the enemy has many spiesin his service birds, beasts. is it safe? never put it on. .for the agents of the dark lordwill be drawn to its power. always remember, frodo. .the ring is trying to get backto its master. it wants to be found. this is it. this is what? if i take one more step. .it'll be the farthest awayfrom home i've ever been. come on, sam. remember what bilbo used to say it's a dangerous business, frodo. bilbo going out your door. you step onto the road,and if you don't keep your feet. .there's no knowing whereyou might be swept off to. suns me sam. wood elves. they're going to the harborbeyond the white towers. to the grey havens. sam they're leaving middle earth. frodo never to return. i don't know why. .it makes me sad. everywhere i lie there's a dirtygreat root sticking into my back. just shut your eyes. .and imagine you're backin your own bed. .with a soft mattressand a lovely feather pillow. it's not working, mr. frodo. i'm never going to be ableto sleep out here. me neither, sam. male voice smoke risesfrom the mountain of doom. the hour grows late. and gandalf the greyrides to lsengard. .seeking my counsel. for that is why you have come,is it not? my old friend. saruman. saruman you are sure of this?gandalf beyond any doubt. so the ring of power has been found. all these long years,it was in the shire. under my very nose. yet you did not have the wit to see it. your love of the half ling's leafhas clearly slowed your mind. but we still have time. time enoughto counter sauron if we act quickly. time? what time do you think we have? sauron has regainedmuch of his former strength. he cannot yet take physical form. .but his spirit has lostnone of its potency. concealed within his fortress,the lord of mordor sees all. his gaze pierces cloud, shadow,earth and flesh. you know of what i speak, gandalf. a great eye, lidless,wreathed in flame. the eye of sauron. he is gathering all evil to him. very soon, he'll have summonedan army great enough. .for an assault upon middle earth. you know this? h ow? i have seen it. a palantir is a dangerous tool,saruman. why? why should we fear to use it? they are not all accounted for,the lost seeing stones. we do not know who elsemay be watching. the hour is later than you think. sauron's forces are already moving. the nine have left minas morgul. the nine? they crossed the river lsenon midsummer's eve. .disguised as riders in black. they've reached the shire? they will find the ring. and kill the one who carries it. frodo! you did not seriously think that a hobbitcould contend with the will of sauron? there are none who can. against the power of mordor. .there can be no victory. we must join with him, gandalf. we must join with sauron. it would be wise, my friend. tell me. .friend. .when did saruman the wiseabandon reason for madness? i gave you the chance. .of aiding me willingly. .but you have electedthe way of pain! sam mr. frodo? frodo? frodo! i thought i'd lost you. what are you talking about? it's just something gandalf said. what did he say?

packed already? no harm in being prepared. i thought you wanted to see the elves. i do. more than anything. i did. it's just. we did what gandalf wanted, didn't we? we got the ring this far,to rivendell. and i thought. .seeing as how you're on the mend,we'd be off soon. off home. you are right, sam. we did what we set out to do. the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am ready to go home. elrond his strength returns. that wound will never fully heal.he will carry it the rest of his life. and yet to have come so farstill bearing the ring. .the hobbit has shown extraordinaryresilience to its evil. it is a burden he should neverhave had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo. gandalf, the enemy is moving. sauron's forces are massing in the east.his eye is fixed on rivendell. and saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. our list of allies grows thin. his treachery runs deeperthan you know. by foul craft, sarumanhas crossed orcs with goblin men. he's breeding an armyin the caverns of lsengard. an army that can move in sunlightand cover great distance at speed. saruman is coming for the ring. this evil cannot be concealedby the power of the elves. we do not have the strengthto fight both mordor and lsengard! gandalf. .the ring cannot stay here. elrond this peril belongsto all middle earth. they must decide now how to end it. the time of the elves is over.my people are leaving these shores. who will you look to when we've gone?the dwarves? they hide in mountains seeking riches.they care not for the troubles of others. it is in menthat we must place our hope. men? men are weak.the race of men is failing. the blood of numenor is all but spent,its pride and dignity forgotten. it is because of menthe ring survives. i was there, gandalf. i was there years ago. .when lsildur took the ring. i was there the daythe strength of men failed. lsildur, hurry! follow me. elrond . i led lsildur into the heartof mount doom. .where the ring was forged,the one place it could be destroyed. cast it into the fire! destroy it! no. lsildur! elrond it should have ended that day,but evil was allowed to endure. lsildur kept the ring.the line of kings is broken. there's no strength leftin the world of men. they're scattered, divided, leaderless. there is one who could unite them. one who could reclaimthe throne of gondor. he turned from that patha long time ago. he has chosen exile. you are no elf. men of the south are welcome here. who are you? i am a friend to gandalf the grey. then we are here on common purpose. .friend. the shards of narsil. the blade that cut the ringfrom sauron's hand. it's still sharp. but no more than a broken heirloom. why do you fear the past? you are lsildur's heir,not lsildur himself. you are not bound to his fate. the same blood ows in my veins. the same weakness. your time will come. you will face the same evil.and you will defeat it. the shadow does not hold sway yet. not over you. not over me. do you remember when we first met? thought i had strayed into a dream. long years have passed. you did not have the cares you carry now. do you remember what i told you? you said you'd bind yourself to me. .forsaking the immortal lifeof your people. and to that i hold. i would rather shareone lifetime with you. .than face all the agesof this world alone. i choose a mortal life. you cannot give me this. it is mine to give to whom i will. .like my heart. elrond strangers from distant lands,friends of old. .you've been summoned hereto answer the threat of mordor. middle earth stands upon the brinkof destruction. none can escape it. you will unite, or you will fall. each race is bound to this fate,this one doom. bring forth the ring, frodo. so it is true. in a dream. .i saw the eastern sky grow dark. .but in the westa pale light lingered. a voice was crying your doom is near at hand. lsildur's bane is found. lsildur's bane. boromir! never before has any voice uttered thewords of that tongue here in lmladris. i do not ask your pardon,master elrond. .for the black speech of mordor. .may yet be heard. .in every corner of the west! the ring is altogether evil. it is a gift. a gift to the foes of mordor. why not use this ring? long has my father,the steward of gondor. .kept the forces of mordor at bay.by the blood of our people. .are your lands kept safe. give gondor the weapon of the enemy.let us use it against him. you cannot wield it.none of us can. the one ring answers to sauron alone.it has no other master. and what would a ranger knowof this matter? this is no mere ranger. he is aragorn, son of arathorn. you owe him your allegiance. aragorn. this is lsildur's heir? and heir to the throne of gondor. sit down, legolas. gondor has no king. gondor needs no king. aragorn is right. we cannot use it. you have only one choice. the ring must be destroyed. what are we waiting for? the ring cannot be destroyed, gimli,son of gl in. .by any craft that we here possess. the ring was made in the firesof mount doom. only there can it be unmade. it must be taken deep into mordor. .and cast back into the fiery chasmfrom whence it came. one of you. .must do this. one does not simply walk into mordor. its black gates are guardedby more than just orcs. there is evil therethat does not sleep. the great eye is ever watchful. it is a barren wasteland. .riddled with fire, and ashand dust. the very air you breatheis a poisonous fume. not with , mencould you do this. it is folly. have you heard nothing lord elrondhas said? the ring must be destroyed. and i suppose you thinkyou are the one to do it! and if we fail, what then? what happenswhen sauron takes back what is his? i will be dead before i see the ringin the hands of an elf! never trust an elf! gandalf do you not understand?while you bicker, sauron's power grows! none can escape it!you'll all be destroyed! i will take it. i will take it. i will take the ring to mordor. though. .i do not know the way. i will help you bearthis burden, frodo baggins. .as long as it is yours to bear. if by my lifeor death i can protect you. .i will. you have my sword. and you have my bow. and my ax. you carry the fatesof us all, little one. if this is indeedthe will of the council. .then gondor will see it done. hey! frodo's not going anywhere without me. it is hardly possible to separate you. .even when he is summonedto a secret council and you are not. we're coming too! you'll have to send us hometied up in a sack to stop us. anyway, you need peopleof intelligence on this sort of. .mission. quest. thing. well, that rules you out, pip. nine companions. so be it. you shall bethe fellowship of the ring. great! where are we going? elrond she wanted to protect her child. she thought in rivendellyou would be safe. in her heart, your motherknew you'd be hunted all your life. that you'd never escape your fate. the skill of the elvescan reforge the sword of kings. .but only you have the powerto wield it. i do not want that power. i have never wanted it. you are the last of that bloodline.there is no other. bilbo my old sword! sting. here, take it. take it. it's so light. yes. made by the elves, you know. the blade glows bluewhen orcs are close. and it's times like that, my lad,when you have to be extra careful. here's a pretty thing. mithril. as light as a feather,and as hard as dragon scales. let me see you put it on. come on. uh! my old ring. i should very much like. .to hold it again, one last time. i'm sorry i brought this upon you,my boy. i'm sorry that youmust carry this burden. i'm sorry for everything. the ring bearer is setting outon the quest of mount doom. on you who travel with him,no oath. .nor bond is laid to go furtherthan you will. farewell. hold to your purpose. may the blessings of elves and men. .and all free folk go with you. the fellowship awaits the ring bearer. mordor, gandalf, is it left or right? left. gan dalf we must hold to this course,west of the misty mountains, for days. if our luck holds, the gap of rohanwill still be open to us. from there, our roadturns east to mordor. two, one, five. good! very good. move your feet. merry you look good, pippin. thanks. boromir faster! if anyone was to ask for my opinion,which i note they're not. .i'd say we were takingthe long way 'round. gandalf, we could pass throughthe mines of moria. my cousin balin would give usa royal welcome. no, i would not take the road throughmoria unless i had no other choice. sorry! merry get him! merry for the shire!pippin hold him. hold him down, merry! gentlemen, that's enough. merry you've got my arm!you've got my arm! what is that? nothing. it's just a wisp of cloud. it's moving fast. against the wind. crebain from dunland! hide! hurry! take cover! spies of saruman. the passage south is being watched. we must take the pass of caradhras. aragorn frodo! boromir. it is a strange fate that we shouldsuffer so much fear and doubt. .over so small a thing. such a little thing. boromir! give the ring to frodo. as you wish. i care not. so, gandalf, you tryto lead them over caradhras. and if that fails,where then will you go? if the mountain defeats you. .will you riska more dangerous road? there is a fell voice on the air. it's saruman! he's trying to bring down the mountain!gandalf, we must turn back! no! we must get off the mountain! make for the gap of rohan,and take the west road to my city! the gap of rohan takes ustoo close to lsengard! gimli we cannot pass over a mountain.let us go under it. let us go through the mines of moria. saruman . moria. you fear to gointo those mines. the dwarves delved too greedilyand too deep. you know what they awokein the darkness of khazad dfim shadow and flame. let the ring bearer decide. we cannot stay here! this will be the death of the hobbits. frodo? we will go through the mines. so be it. frodo, come and help an old man. how is your shoulder? better than it was. and the ring? you feel its power growing, don't you? i've felt it too.you must be careful now. evil will be drawn to youfrom outside the fellowship. and, i fear, from within. who then do i trust? you must trust yourself. trust your own strengths. what do you mean? there are many powers in this world. .for good or for evil. some are greater than i am. and against some i have not yetbeen tested. the walls. .of moria. dwarf doors are invisible when closed. gandalf their own masters cannot findthem if their secrets are forgotten. why doesn't that surprise me? well, let's see. ithildin. it mirrors only starlightand moonlight. it reads, the doors of durin,lord of moria. speak, friend, and enter. what do you suppose that means? it's simple. if you are a friend, you speakthe password and the doors will open. nothing's happening. i once knew every spellin all the tongues of elves. .men and orcs. what are you going to do, then? knock your head against these doors,peregrin took! and if that does not shatter them. .and i am allowed a little peacefrom foolish questions. .i will try to find the opening words. mines are no place for a pony. even one so brave as bill. bye bye, bill. go on, bill. go on. don't worry, sam,he knows the way home. do not disturb the water. oh, it's useless. it's a riddle. speak 'friend' and enter. what's the elvish word for friend ? mellon. gimli soon, master elf, you will enjoythe fabled hospitality of the dwarves. roaring fires, malt beer,ripe meat off the bone! this, my friend,is the home of my cousin balin. and they call it a mine. a mine! this is no mine. it's a tomb. gimli no. no. no! goblins. we make for the gap of rohan.we should never have come here. aragorn now, get out of here. get out! merry frodo!frodo help! strider! frodo help!sam get off him! aragorn! frodo! strider! into the mines! legolas!aragorn into the cave! run! gandalf we now have but one choice. we must face the long dark of moria. be on your guard. there are olderand fouler things than orcs. .in the deep places of the world. quietly now. it's a four day journeyto the other side. let us hope that our presencemay go unnoticed. the wealth of moria is not in gold. .or jewels. .but mithril. bilbo had a shirt of mithril ringsthat thorin gave him. oh, that was a kingly gift. yes. i never told him. .but its worth was greater thanthe value of the shire. pippin. i have no memory of this place. pippin are we lost?merry no. pippin i think we are.merry gandalf's thinking. pippin merry?merry what? pippin i'm hungry. there's something down there. it's gollum. gollum? he's been following us for three days. he escaped the dungeons of barad d r? escaped. .or was set loose. now the ring has brought him here. he will never be rid of his need for it. he hates and loves the ring,as he hates and loves himself. sm agol's life is a sad story. yes, smeagol he was once called.before the ring found him. before it drove him mad. it's a pity bilbo didn't kill himwhen he had the chance. pity? it is pity that stayed bilbo's hand. many that live deserve death.some that die deserve life. can you give it to them, frodo? do not be too eagerto deal out death and judgment. even the very wisecannot see all ends. my heart tells me that gollum has somepart to play yet, for good or ill. .before this is over. the pity of bilbomay rule the fate of many. i wish the ringhad never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times.but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to dowith the time that is given to us. there are other forces at work in thisworld, frodo, besides the will of evil. bilbo was meant to find the ring. in which case,you also were meant to have it. and that is an encouraging thought. ah! it's that way. he's remembered.gan dalf no. but the air doesn't smellso foul down here. if in doubt, meriadoc,always follow your nose. let me risk a little more light. behold. .the great realmand dwarf city of dwarrowdelf. there's an eye opener, and no mistake. gimli! no. no! oh, no. no. gandalf here lies balin. .son of fundin. .lord of moria. he is dead, then. it's as i feared. we must move on. we cannot linger. gandalf they have taken the bridgeand the second hall. we have barred the gates. .but cannot hold them for long. the ground shakes. drums. .drums in the deep. we cannot get out. a shadow moves in the dark. we cannot get out. they are coming. fool of a took! throw yourself in next time,and rid us of your stupidity. sam frodo! orcs. get back! stay close to gandalf! they have a cave troll. let them come! there is one dwarf yet in moriawho still draws breath. i think i'm getting the hang of this. frodo! frodo aragorn! aragorn! frodo! frodo! frodo! oh, no. he's alive. i'm all right. i'm not hurt. you should be dead. that spear would have skewereda wild boar. i think there's more to this hobbitthan meets the eye. mithril. you are full of surprises,master baggins. to the bridge of khazad dfim! aragorn this way! what is this new devilry? a balrog. a demon of the ancient world. this foe is beyond any of you. run! quickly! gandalf. lead them on, aragorn. the bridge is near. do as i say!swords are no more use here. gandalf! boromir merry! pippin! sam! nobody tosses a dwarf. not the beard! steady. hold on! hang on! lean forward! steady. come on! now! over the bridge! fly! you cannot pass! gandalf! i am a servant of the secret fire,wielder of the flame of anor. the dark fire will not avail you,flame of udfm! go back to the shadow. you shall not pass! boromir no! no! gandalf! fly, you fools! no! aragorn! legolas, get them up. give them a moment, for pity's sake! by nightfall, these hills willbe swarming with orcs. we must reach the woods of lothl rien. come, boromir. legolas.gimli, get them up. on your feet, sam. frodo? frodo! stay close, young hobbits! they say that a great sorceresslives in these woods. an elf witch. .of terrible power. all who look upon her. .fall under her spell. female voice frodo! and are never seen again. female voice your coming to us isas the footsteps of doom. you bring great evil here,ring bearer. sam mr. frodo? well, here's one dwarfshe won't ensnare so easily. i have the eyes of a hawkand the ears of a fox. the dwarf breathes so loud,we could have shot him in the dark. welcome legolas, son of thranduil. our fellowship stands in your debt. aragorn of the dunedain. you are known to us. so much for the legendary courtesyof the elves! speak words we can all understand! we have not had dealingswith the dwarves since the dark days. and you know what this dwarfsays to that? that was not so courteous. you bring great evil with you. you can go no further. gandalf's death was not in vain. nor would he have you give up hope. you carry a heavy burden, frodo. don't carry the weight of the dead. you will follow me. caras galadhon. the heart of elvendom on earth. realm of the lord celebornand of galadriel, lady of light. the enemy knows you have entered here. what hope you had in secrecyis now gone. eight there are here, yet nine therewere set out from rivendell. tell me, where is gandalf? for i much desire to speak with him. i can no longer see him from afar. galadriel gandalf the grey did notpass the borders of this land. he has fallen into shadow. he was taken by both shadow and flame. a balrog of morgoth. for we went needlesslyinto the net of moria. needless were none of the deedsof gandalf in life. we do not yet know his full purpose. do not let the great emptinessof khazad dfim fill your heart. .gimli, son of gl in. for the world has grownfull of peril. .and in all lands. .love is now mingled with grief. what now becomes of this fellowship? without gandalf, hope is lost. the quest stands upon the edgeof a knife. stray but a little and it will fail. .to the ruin of all. yet hope remainswhile the company is true. do not let your hearts be troubled.go now and rest. .for you are weary with sorrowand much toil. tonight, you will sleep. galadriel welcome, frodo of the shire. .one who has seen the eye! a lament for gandalf. what do they say about him? i have not the heart to tell you. for me, the grief is still too near. i bet they don't mention his fireworks. there should be a verse about them. the finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder, silver showers came falling like a rain of flowers oh, that doesn't do them justiceby a long road. aragorn take some rest. these borders are well protected. i will find no rest here. i heard her voice inside my head. she spoke of my fatherand the fall of gondor. she said to me, even now there is hope left. but i cannot see it. it is long since we had any hope. my father is a noble man. but his rule is failing. .and our people lose faith. he looks to me to make things right,and i would do it. i would see the gloryof gondor restored. have you ever seen it, aragorn? the white tower of ecthelion. glimmering like a spikeof pearl and silver. its banners caught highin the morning breeze. have you ever been called home. .by the clear ringingof silver trumpets? i have seen the white city. .long ago. one day, our paths will lead us there. and the tower guardshall take up the call the lords of gondor have returned. will you look into the mirror? what will i see? even the wisest cannot tell. for the mirror. .shows many things. things that were. .things that are. .and some things. .that have not yet come to pass. i know what it is you saw. for it is also in my mind. it is what will come to passif you should fail. the fellowship is breaking.it is already begun. he will try to take the ring. you know of whom i speak. one by one, it will destroy them all. frodo if you ask it of me. .i will give you the one ring. you offer it to me freely. i do not deny that my hearthas greatly desired this. in place of a dark lord,you would have a queen. .not dark but beautiful,and terrible as the dawn! treacherous as the sea! stronger than the foundationsof the earth! all shall love me. .and despair. i pass the test. i will diminish. .and go into the west. .and remain galadriel. i cannot do this alone. you are a ring bearer, frodo.to bear a ring of power. .is to be alone. this is nenya,the ring of adamant. and i am its keeper. this task was appointed to you. and if you do not find a way. .no one will. then i know what i must do. it's just. .i'm afraid to do it. even the smallest person can changethe course of the future. do you know how the orcsfirst came into being? they were elves once. taken by the dark powers. .tortured and mutilated. a ruined and terrible form of life. and now. .perfected. my fighting uruk hai. .whom do you serve? saruman! hunt them down. do not stopuntil they are found. you do not know pain.you do not know fear. you will taste man flesh! one of the half lings carriessomething of great value. bring them to me alive and unspoiled. kill the others. celeborn never before have we cladstrangers in the garb of our own people. may these cloaks help shield youfrom unfriendly eyes. lembas. elvish waybread. one small bite is enough to fillthe stomach of a grown man. how many did you eat? four. celeborn every league you travel south,the danger will increase. mordor orcs now hold the eastern shoreof the anduin. nor will you find safetyon the western bank. strange creatures bearing the white handhave been seen on our borders. seldom do orcs journey in the openunder the sun, yet these have done so. you are being tracked. by river you have the chance. .of outrunning the enemyto the falls of rauros. galadriel my gift for you, legolas,is a bow of the galadhrim. worthy of the skillof our woodland kin. these are the daggers of the noldorin. they have already seen service in war. do not fear, young peregrin took. you will find your courage. and for you, samwise gamgee. .elven rope made of hithlain. thank you, my lady. have you run outof those nice, shiny daggers? and what gift would a dwarf askof the elves? nothing. except to look upon the ladyof the galadhrim one last time. .for she is more fairthan all the jewels beneath the earth. actually. there was one thing. no, no, i'm talking nonsense.it's quite impossible. stupid to ask. galadriel i have nothing greater to give. .than the gift you already bear. for her love, i fear the grace of arwen evenstarwill diminish. i would have her leave these shores, and be with her people. i would have her take the ship to valinor. that choice is yet before her. you have your own choice to make,aragorn. to rise above the height of allyour fathers since the days of elendil. .or to fall into darknesswith all that is left of your kin. farewell. there is much you have yet to do. we shall not meet again. elessar. farewell, frodo baggins. i give you the light of e rendil. .our most beloved star. may it be a light for youin dark places. .when all other lights go out. gimli i have taken my worst woundat this parting. .having looked my last upon thatwhich is fairest. henceforth i will call nothing fairunless it be her gift to me. what was her gift? i asked her for one hairfrom her golden head. she gave me three. gollum. he has tracked us since moria. i had hoped we would lose himon the river. but he's too clever a waterman. and if he alerts the enemyto our whereabouts. .it will make the crossingeven more dangerous. sam have some food, mr. frodo. no, sam. you haven't eaten anything all day. you're not sleeping, neither.don't think i haven't noticed. mr. frodo i'm all right. but you're not. i'm hereto help you. i promised gandalf that i would. you can't help me, sam. not this time. get some sleep. minas tirith is the safer road. you know that.from there we can regroup. strike out for mordor from a placeof strength. there is no strength in gondorthat can avail us. you were quick enough to trustthe elves. have you so little faithin your own people? yes, there is weakness.there is frailty. but there is courage also,and honor to be found in men. but you will not see that. you are afraid! all your life, you have hiddenin the shadows. scared of who you are,of what you are. i will not lead the ring withina hundred leagues of your city. frodo. the argonath. long have i desiredto look upon the kings of old. my kin. we cross the lake at nightfall. hide the boats and continue on foot. we approach mordor from the north. oh, yes? just a simple matter of findingour way through emyn muil. .an impassable labyrinthof razor sharp rocks. and after that, it gets even better. festering, stinking marshlandas far as the eye can see. that is our road. i suggest you take some restand recover your strength, master dwarf. recover my we should leave now. no. orcs patrol the eastern shore.we must wait for cover of darkness. it is not the eastern shorethat worries me. a shadow and a threathas been growing in my mind. something draws near.i can feel it. recover strength?pay no heed to that, young hobbit. where's frodo? boromir none of us should wander alone. you, least of all. so much depends on you. frodo? i know why you seek solitude. you suffer. i see it day by day. you sure you do not suffer needlessly? there are other ways, frodo. other paths that we might take. i know what you would say. it would seem like wisdombut for the warning in my heart. warning? against what? we're all afraid, frodo. but to let that fear drive us,to destroy what hope we have. .don't you see that is madness? there is no other way. i ask only for the strengthto defend my people! if you would but lend me the ring. no. why do you recoil? i am no thief. you are not yourself. what chance do you think you have? they will find you.they will take the ring. and you will beg for deathbefore the end! you fool! it is not yours, save by unhappy chance!it could have been mine. it should be mine! give it to me! give it to me! no! give it to me! no. i see your mind. you will take the ring to sauron! you will betray us! you'll go to your death,and the death of us all! curse you!curse you and all the half lings! frodo? frodo. what have i done? please, frodo. frodo, i'm sorry! frodo! frodo? it has taken boromir. where is the ring? stay away! frodo! i swore to protect you. can you protect me from yourself? would you destroy it?
