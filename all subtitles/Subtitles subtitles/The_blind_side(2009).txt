no. they're not gonna start recruiting till they hire another coach. doesn't make any difference unless michael makes his grades. ahem. what are we gonna do? i understand you applied for a teaching position at wingate. i wasn't religious enough for them. i'm a spiritual person, mrs. tuohy, but i have certain, shall we say, doubts. well, l appreciate your honesty, miss sue. what's the situation with michael?

mrs. tuohy, um, there's something you should know about me. i don't usually tell many people. . .but it's something l feel you should be aware of before you hire me. uh what is it? i'm a democrat. okay. l don't understand it. yet. you don't understand it yet. how big is your head, michael? big. and what's in there? a brain. a brain. it's full of knowledge. like a file cabinet with maps, and shortcuts for figuring things out. you'll get there, michael oher, because i'm here to help you use those maps. . . . .and reach your destination, like sacagawea led lewis and clark. sacagawea? we'll get to that. and the history books have it wrong. all you need to know is l'll get you there. do you believe me? you trust me, michael? yes, miss sue. try it again. what's the next one? read that to me. okay, what does it say? first we have to find the constant. now, where is the constant? good. see? who'd have thought we'd have a black son before we knew a democrat? doorbell rlngs lelgh anne doorbell! sean i got it, guys. coach, how are you?

l've been thinking a lot about that. . .and one of the things i think would be special. . . .is we'll walk arm in arm to the center of neyland stadium in the first ball game. . . . .and do the coin toss together. how's that sound? coach fulmer, it's a pleasure doing business with you. my pleasure, cj. you bet you, buddy. doorbell rlngs congratulations on getting hired. thank you, ma'am. ole miss is my dream job. you're coming a little late to the party and we're diehard rebels. . .so l'm gonna pretty much give you a road map. got it. lsu is out. everybody knows saban's going to the nfl. don't wanna name names, but on michael's first two trips. . . . .somebody took him to a titty bar. terrible. tell me about it. he had nightmares for weeks. so when he visits, i want you to feed him ltalian. he likes fettuccine alfredo. and take him to a movie. not chainsaw massacre because he'll just cover his eyes. then get him in bed by . got it? yes, ma'am. all right. what about tennessee? mm. breaks my heart, but they're still in the hunt. ahem. fulmer made sj a sweet deal. l hear that kid can really pepper the gumbo. hmm. he's his daddy's boy. you ready? let's do it. all right. ed mike, do you love barbecue? i tell you what, mike. you can go to a gas station and get the best barbecue you ever got. it's a wonderful place to live. fried catfish, all the good food that we love to eat and that's not good for us. . . . .you can have it there, mike, i promise you. and for you, sj, this is what i can do. at ole miss, we have the grove by the stadium. we walk it before every game in front of thousands of people. it's a sacred ritual. and l'm in front. seen it a thousand times. ever seen it from the front of the line? next year, you and me, leading the team. tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin. i'll throw in a sideline pass. have you decided yet, michael? no, miss sue. but you like tennessee? yeah. that's a good school. not at the academic level of ole miss. . . . .but they have a outstanding science department. you know what they're famous for? they work with the fbi . . . .to study the effects of soil on decomposing body parts. what's that mean? well, when they find a body, the police wanna know how long it's been dead. so the fine folks at tennessee help them out. oh, they have lots of body parts. arms and legs and hands. . . .from hospitals and medical schools. and do you know where they store them? right underneath the football field. so while it's fine and dandy to have , fans cheering for you. . .the bodies you should be worried about are the ones right under the turf. set to poke up through the ground and grab you. well, it's your decision where you wanna play ball. don't let me influence you. all the other teachers are on board. i don't know what your problem is. i'm sorry. i will not give a student a grade he or she doesn't deserve. well, michael needs a b. what does he have to do to deserve that? right now michael's doing c minus, d plus work. his best chance at improvement is the written essay at the end of the year. it counts for a third of the grade. well, that's it. we're sunk. why don't you write about great expectations? you're a lot like pip. i mean, he was poor. he was an orphan and someone kind of found him. you should be able to relate to that. fine. we'll go through the reading list. but you're gonna have to pick one, michael. pygmalion. a tale of two cities. the charge of the light brigade. half a league, half a league half a league onward i love that one. he loves it. why don't you do this? and l'll watch basketball. sean okay. all in the valley of death rode the six hundred. they named lsu's stadium death valley because of this story. alfred, lord tennyson was writing about lsu ole miss. you're kidding. no. lt's a great story. lt's a poem! forward, the light brigade! that's like the offense. charge for the guns, he said it's the end zone. into the valley of death rode the six hundred. forward, the light brigade! was there a man dismay'd? not tho' the soldier knew someone had blunder'd someone made a mistake? yeah. their leader. their coach. but why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up? theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why theirs but to do and die into the valley of death rode the six hundred. they're all gonna die, aren't they? yeah. that's really, really sad. i think you just found something to write about, michael. mlchael courage is a hard thing to figure. you can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake. .but you're not supposed to question adults. .or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules. maybe they know best, but maybe they don't. it all depends on who you are, where you come from. didn't at least one of the guys think about giving up. .and joining with the other side? i mean, valley of death, that's pretty salty stuff. that's why courage is tricky. should you always do what others tell you to do? sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something. i mean, any fool can have courage. but honor, that's the real reason you either do something or you don't. it's who you are and maybe who you want to be. if you die trying for something important. .then you have both honor and courage, and that's pretty good. i think that's what the writer was saying. that you should hope for courage and try for honor. and maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some too. kevin lin. good job. excuse me. excuse me. excuse me. matthew nichols. . . hmm? michael's final gpa. got it off of paul's computer. he did it, sean. he did it. wait a minute. you broke into the principal's computer? hmm? michael oher. girl michael. where in the world did you find a baby picture of michael?
