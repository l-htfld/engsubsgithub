mommy! mom! you look so beautiful. so do you. look at you. oh, i'm sorry. mom, dad, this is greg. hi, greg. i'm pam's father, jack byrnes. great to finally meet you. good meeting you. and i'm dina. welcome to oyster bay. what are you driving there, a ford? oh, yeah, it's a taurus. we were gonna get a mid size, but i figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks. might as well go all out, pop for the full size. sure. interesting color. you pick it? oh, no, the guy at the counter. why? well, they say geniuses pick green. but you didn't pick it. jack! oh, yucky. what smells of old sour milk? oh, poor greg got spit up on by a baby. he didn't. yeah, he did, ma, at the lost luggage counter. the airline lost his bag. they didn't! yeah. yeah, they did. what about you, honey? oh, no, no, no. i carried on. that's my girl. it'll turn up, i'm sure. and anyway, greg, meanwhile, anything you need, just ask. that's right. mi casa es su casa. oh, thanks, jack. you too. this is so nice. we like it. beautiful. oh, now, greg, you have a very unique last name. um, we were curious, how do you pronounce it? oh, just like it's spelled. f o c k e r. focker. hmm, focker. hmm. oh, i'll get it, honey. oh, thanks, mom. oh, there he is. there's our little guy. jinxy, come here, boy. come here, baby. come to daddy, jinxy. come on. come on, jinxy. come here. come to daddy. come on. taught him that in one week. this is pam's cat, jinxy. jinxy, say hello to greg. hi, jinx. wave to greg. hello, jinx. attaboy. that took me another week. oh, my gosh. pam, i didn't know you had a cat. yeah, i left him here when i moved to chicago. your daddy's found his new best friend. you won't believe it. he even taught him to use the potty. he did? dad, that's kinda weird, isn't it? what's so weird about it? now we don't have to smell kitty litter all the time. that's right. that's incredible. how did you teach the cat to use the toilet? oh, that was easy, greg. i just designed a litter box to put inside the toilet, and then once he got used to it, i took it away. yeah, makes sense. but i don't think he likes it. i mean, every chance he gets, he tries to dig, squat and bury. i had to move all my potted plants off the floor. plus, you got another guy around the house to leave the seat up. he can't lift the seat, greg. he lacks the strength and the opposable thumbs. yeah. ah, right. opposable i didn't think about that. jinx is strictly a house cat. can't let him outside because he lacks outdoor survival skills. one of those things, isn't it, sweetheart? i don't think greg will be playing with jinxy too much. he hates cats. pam, i don't hate cats. i don't i don't hate cats. i just happen to be more of a dog lover. yeah, yeah. i am too. well, that's okay if you hate cats, greg. no! i don't. i don't hate cats at all. that's okay. just be honest about it. there's some things i hate. i i'm being honest. really? like what? honey, why don't we let the kids freshen up, huh? greg, you come with me. we'll get you something to wear from jack's closet, okay? yeah? i'm so happy you're home, sweetheart. oh! me too, dad. hey, listen, be nice to this one, okay? i kinda like him. okay, i'll try. thank you. shirt fit okay, greg? oh, fantastic. thanks, jack. good. tom collins coming up. you know, i wish you hadn't told your parents i hate cats. but you do hate cats. yeah, but you didn't have to tell them right when we met. i know. i'm sorry. it just kinda slipped out. get your red hot papooses. my goodness, what is that? oh, that's just a little something from me. go ahead. open it up. oh. look, honey, greg brought us a present. oh, isn't that nice? oh, look at this. it's a flower pot with the dirt in it. actually, the real gift is what's planted in the soil. the bulb of a jerusalem tulip. which i was told is one of the rarest and most beautiful flowers in existence. oh, right, right, the jerusalem from the jerusales tulipesias genus. yes, yes. anyway, yeah, the guy said with regular watering, it should bloom in about months, so oh, we'll look forward to that, greg. so, greg, how's your job? um, good, pam. thanks for asking. i, uh, i recently got transferred to triage. oh, is that better than a nurse? no, mom, triage is a unit of the e.r. it's where all the top nurses work. well no, they do. not many men in your profession, though, are there, greg? no, jack, not traditionally. oh, pam, honey, did you know that your father started his own business? really? dad, that's great. yes, i thought with my knowledge and experience, why should i allow retirement to stop me? i really admire that. yeah. so what is it? what's the new venture? let me ask you a question, greg. let's just say you have kids. and you wanna get out of the house, spend a night on the town. so, you hire a baby sitter, someone you think you can trust. references, work experience it all checks out fine. but then how do you really know for certain. that your loved ones are safe with this stranger? i mean, can you ever really trust another human being, greg? sure, i think so. no, the answer is you cannot. let me show you something. take a look at this, greg. what's this look like to you? this looks like a teddy bear. smile, you're on nanny camera. i've seen these things advertised on tv. oh, no, not like this, you haven't. take a look. oh, my gosh. hi! where's the other camera? right here in this decorative artifact. wow, that's great. our cameras are motion activated, so they begin taping as soon as they sense any movement. we can hide 'em in anything. we hide 'em in mirrors, lamps, televisions, you name it. so no matter where you go, we'll be watching you. so, jack, couldn't this maybe be construed as illegal? you know, invasion of privacy? trust me, greg, when you start having little fockers running around, you'll understand the need for this level of protection. impressive, isn't it? quite. oh, i'll get that. i'll get it. i'll get it. honey, i'll get it. any problem with the documents? okay. i'll meet you at the oyster bay drugstore in about minutes. now you gotta be more careful when you call here. if anybody else answers, just use a southern accent. and ask for the vegetarian special, okay? oh, that wasn't the airline, was it? nope, wrong number. we're all out of collins mix, so i'm gonna make a run for the store. that's funny. i thought i just bought some. you know how that stuff it just goes, so i'll be back in a jiff. well, why doesn't greg go with you? sweetie, you'll need something in case your suitcase doesn't show up. oh, i'm sure it'll show up. yeah. you don't wanna take a chance. you don't have a toothbrush. go on, sweetie. yeah. okay, unless you want some privacy. why would i need privacy? no, i didn't think you would. okay, let's head out. oh, good. bye. have fun, you guys. pam, he seems wonderful. he is. we have the best time together. good. now, have you two been mother! oh, thinking about anything permanent. oh, i don't know. i mean, we haven't really discussed it, but i definitely have a feeling this is it. dad seems to like him. don't you think? absolutely. big day, saturday. yes. this car is you got what do you use? unleaded? regular unleaded? premium. hey, you know, jack, now that we have a second to talk, i just want you to know how much pam means to me. i know i know that we haven't been together that long, but the time that we have spent together has been really incredible. greg, how come you don't like cats? i don't not like cats. i just i just prefer dogs. i mean, i'm just more of a dog kind of, you know come home, wagging their little tails, happy to see you kind of you need that assurance? you prefer an emotionally shallow animal? you see, greg, when you yell at a dog, his tail will go between his legs and cover his genitals, his ears will go down. a dog is very easy to break, but cats make you work for their affection. they don't sell out the way dogs do. you like peter, paul and mary? yes, i do. i'm a big fan. puff the magic dragon dragon lived by the sea great song. yeah, one of my favorites. who would've thought it wasn't really about a dragon, huh? what do you mean? you know, the whole drug thing. no, i don't know. why don't you tell me? some people think that. to puff the magic dragon means to they're really, uh to smoke to smoke a marijuana cigarette. well, puff's just the name of the boy's magical dragon. right. are you a pothead, focker? no! no. what? no, no, no, no, jack. no, i'm i'm not i i pass on grass all the time. i mean, not all the time. yes or no? no. yes. no. hey, greg, i'll meet you back out front in about. to minutes. hey. how you doing? do you have any of those nicotine patches? no. we have the gum. great. you chew it. thank you. yes, okay. and what's your most expensive bottle of champagne? mumm's. it's on sale for . . really? that's it? you don't have, like, a nice, like, or bottle of something? you can get a whole bunch of mumm's. focker. hey, jack. ready to go? i've been ready, yeah. they ran out of collins mix. you been waiting here long? no, i was just reading up about. .pumps. pumps? yes. breast pumps. i grew up on a farm. get your hot buns, hot patooties. wow, dina, everything looks fabulous. it's such a treat for me to have a home cooked meal like this. dinner at my house usually consisted of everybody in the kitchen. fighting over containers of chinese food. you poor thing. what, there wasn't enough food to go around? no, there was. we just never really sat down like a family like this. greg, would you like to say grace? oh, uh, well, greg's jewish, dad. you know that. you're telling me jews don't pray, honey? unless you have some objection. no, no, no, no, i'd love to. pam, come on, it's not like i'm a rabbi or something. i said grace at many a dinner table. oh dear god, thank you. you are such a good god to us, a kind and gentle. and accommodating god. and we thank you, osweet, sweet lord of hosts. for the. smorgasbord. you have so aptly lain at our table this day. and each day. by day. day by day by day. oh dear lord, three things we pray. to love thee more dearly, to see thee more clearly, to follow thee more nearly. day by day. by day. amen. oh, greg, that was lovely. thank you, greg. that was interesting too. oh, that's a that's a lovely vase. that's great. let me guess, jack. is that one of your secret cameras too? greg, that's an urn which holds the remains of jack's mother. oh, i'm sorry. i'm so sorry. that's all right. you didn't know, greg. i'm that's our gran gran. we like to think of her as watching over us as we eat. love you, ma. miss you. miss you every day. oh, honey, why don't you read greg your poem? oh, no, he doesn't want to hear that. what? no! what what what poem? you see, when jack had to retire. .for health reasons that's a bunch of malarky. honey, i'm fine. the doctor thought it would be therapeutic if he. sort of expressed his emotions in an artistic way. honey, you wrote the most beautiful poem about your mother. please, we really wanna hear it. poem, poem. please! oh, all right. it's a work in progress. i'm still not happy with it. as soon as it's ready, then i am going to glaze it onto a plate. .and put it next to the urn. nice. it's very special. my mother by jack byrnes. you gave me life, you gave me milk, 'you gave me courage. your name was angela, the angel from heaven, but you were also an angel of god, and he needed you too. selfishly i tried to keep you here. while the cancer ate away your organs. like an unstoppable rebel force. but i couldn't save you, and i shall see your face. nevermore, nevermore, nevermore, until we meet. in heaven. daddy, that's beautiful. it always gets me. amazing. so so so much love, yet also so much information. it takes a lot out of him. greg, would you like some yams? thank you. oh, yeah. you must've had vegetables fresher than that, growing up on a farm, greg. dad, greg grew up in detroit. he told me he grew up on a farm. do they have many farms in detroit? no, dina, no, not a lot. in fact, jack, i should clarify this. i didn't actually grow up. on a farm per se. the house we grew up in was originally erected. in the early dutch farm, colonial style. so that, plus we had a lot of pets which one did you milk then? dad! honey, he said he pumped milk. what have you ever milked? a cat. a cat? i milked a cat once. you wanna hear a story? sure. my sister had a cat, and the cat birthed a litter of kittens. must've been of them, and there was this one little runt. this little sweet little. little engine that could runt. who wanted to get up there and couldn't really get access to the to the to the to the to the teat. teat? dad. what have you. i went in and just simply, you know, just into a little saucer, then took the saucer and fed it to geppetto that's what i named him. i had i had no idea you could milk a cat. oh, yeah, you can milk anything with nipples. i have nipples, greg. could you milk me? okay, could we change the subject perhaps? champagne, champagne. yes. i thought maybe we could celebrate with a little bubbly. that'd be great. good idea. yum! i have nipples. can you milk me? well, in a funny way, you've already seen deb's ring. that's true. would anybody care for a bottle of oyster bay drug and sundries finest champagne? that is so sweet of you, greg. isn't that a nice gesture? that's very nice. how could i have seen debbie's ring, mom? well, when i gave bob the okay to propose to deb, i put him in touch with my diamond guy, and he picked out the same design kevin gave you. kevin, your old boyfriend? thanks, dad. well, yeah, kevin was pam's fiance. oh, my god. oh! jinxy, no! greg, sweetie, how you doing? oh, just fine, considering i desecrated your grandma's remains, found out you were engaged and had your father ask me to milk him. at least back then he was still talking to me. i can't believe you didn't tell me you were that close. who, daddy and me? no, kevin and you. do we have to know everything about each other's pasts? you never told me about your cat milking days in motown. that was a long time ago, pam. yeah, okay, well, so was this. kevin's and my connection was more physical than anything else. physical? like what? like you worked out together? no, no, it was nothing, nothing. it was a stupid sexual thing. i'm gonna go throw up now. greg, listen. kevin and i were only engaged for a month before i realized that i'd made a mistake, okay? i gave back the ring, i moved to chicago, and i met and fell in love with you, okay, so can we please drop this? good. i just feel like this is not going well at all. i feel like your dad hates me. he doesn't hate you, sweetie. come on. just give him a chance, all right? maybe he's nervous too, huh? i thought he would love my gift, you know, being this big flower guy, but it's like he didn't even show the slightest bit of interest. listen to me. forget the gift. you are the most adorable, loving, sweetest man in the whole world, and i love you. and very soon my parents are gonna see that. and grow to love you too, okay? speaking of growing to love you honey, it's late. i know it's late. but mr. winky is still on chicago time, and we both know there's only one way to make mr. winky go away. and there it is. what's with the robe?

no, not at all. i mean, i mean i mean, this is great, though. i love this what you it's a cozy little nook. i noticed you were looking at that when i came in. yeah. it's an antique polygraph machine. is that what that is?

yes, i did. no peeking. did we eat pot roast for dinner tonight? yes. was it under cooked? no, it was rare. it was a little rare for my taste. but i wouldn't i'm just kidding, i'm just relax. relax. the needles are jumping. have you ever watched pornographic videos? i mean, well, i don't yes or no? what's the matter? you can't sleep? no, no, i'm just going over some of my answers from the polygraph test your dad gave me. oh, no, he didn't. yeah, he did. well, did you lie to him? no! i mean well, he asked me if we were living together, and what'd you tell him? nothing. your mother walked in. and yanked the little thingies off before i had to answer. is this how you'd react if i told you he shoved bamboo shoots up my fingernails? or does he hook all your boyfriends up to his little machine? well, he doesn't need a machine. he's a human lie detector. what? greg, my father was never in the rare flower business. that was just his cover. he was in the c.i.a. for years. how could you not tell me this? i wanted to, honey, but it was strictly. on a need to know basis. so, what? he's in the c.i.a.? he was a spy? he is a spy? no, he was more like a psychological profiler. they used him to interrogate suspected double agents in the company. oh, that's great. yeah. i was scared of your dad back when i thought he was a florist. it's wonderful to know that i've actually got a c.i.a. spy hunter on my ass. would you stop? you're doing great, okay? this is a lot to take in, honey. i'm sorry. it's just weird. oh, i know, but you're doing fine. i promise. mm, no, no! w what's wrong, sweetie? i forgot. i'm not supposed to let the snake out of my cage. your what?

no, i did okay. oh, he did more than okay. trust me. why did you take the test if you weren't planning on going to med school? well, i wanted to keep my options open, but in the end, nursing was a better fit for me. it gives you the freedom to work in several different areas of medicine. plus, i can focus on patient care, as opposed to being a doctor where you have to deal with the bureaucracy. wasn't your friend andy supposed to be here by now? oh, my god! i thought deb told you. dr. andy threw out his back. he can't make the wedding. oh, damn. now i have to reconfigure the whole procession. bob, why doesn't greg stand in for andy, be the usher?

the matter, greg, r.n., is that when this toilet is flushed, it runs, and when you have a septic tank that's nearly full and a toilet that's been running all night, then you could have a hell of a problem. mr. byrnes?

i don't think so. you don't? i am going to need your baggage claim number again. jinx, stop. i know i signed for it. i'm looking at your signature right here, mr. focker. do me a favor. could i talk to your supervisor?

i'm sorry. what are you going to tell me next? that you set kevin's altar on fire? oh, my god. well, it wasn't intentional. i was chasing jinx up onto the roof. i had a smoke, and i think i might have lit something that i don't know what happened. he put so much goddamn lacquer on that thing. it was an accident waiting to happen. this is very disappointing, greg. get out of my house, focker, and take your friend with you. so you lied to me about everything, huh, greg?

look at this place! he almost destroyed the wedding because he lied! i love you daddy, but you can be a real jerk sometimes. so what if he took the mcats? he's still not good enough for pam. who is, jack? nobody has ever been good enough for your pam. i mean, do you realize that you never even warmed up to kevin until she broke up with him? maybe it's time you think about what pam wants. greg, it's me. i'm sure you're in the air by now, so i guess you'll just get this when you get home. listen, i am so sorry. i acted like a complete idiot, and i hope that you can forgive me. i mean, i i don't care about the fire or the cat or i mean, i can't believe you actually spray painted a cat. that's actually really gross, but th the point is that that i understand why you did it, and and i love you. i want you to know that i really i really, really love you, and, uh when you get this, will you please call me?
