 well, i shall never be king. and you shall never seethe light of another day. adieu. didn't your mother ever tell younot to play with your food? what do you want? i'm here to announce that king mufasa's on his way, so you'd better have a good excuse for missing this morning's ceremony. oh, look, zazu.you've made me lose my lunch. you'll lose more than thatwhen the king gets through with you. he's as mad as a hippo with a hernia. i quiver with fear! now, scar, don't look at me that way. help! scar? mm hmm? drop him. impeccable timing, your majesty. why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on highto mingle with the commoners. sarabi and i didn't see youat the presentation of simba. that was today? i feel simply awful! must've slipped my mind. yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother,you should've been first in line! well, i was first in line, until the little hairball was born. that hairball is my son and your future king. i shall practise my curtsy! don't turn your back on me, scar. oh, no, mufasa. perhaps you shouldn'tturn your back on me. is that a challenge? temper, temper. i wouldn't dream of challenging you. pity. why not? well, as far as brains go,i got the lion's share. but when it comes to brute strength, i'm afraid i'm at the shallow endof the gene pool. there's one in every family, sire. two in mine, actually, and they always manage toruin special occasions. what am i going to do with him? he'd make a very handsome throw rug. zazu! and just think,whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him. hmm. simba. dad! dad! come on, dad, we gotta go! wake up! uhh! sorry. dad! dad! your son is awake. before sunrise, he's your son. dad! come on, dad. you promised. okay, okay.i'm up, i'm up. yeah! mufasa look, simba. everything the lighttouches is our kingdom. wow. a king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. one day, simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king. and this'll all be mine? everything. everything the light touches. what about that shadowy place? that's beyond our borders. you must never go there, simba. but i thought a kingcan do whatever he wants. oh, there's more to being king than. getting your way all the time. there's more? simba. everything you see exists togetherin a delicate balance. as king, you need tounderstand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. but, dad, don't we eat the antelope? yes, simba, but let me explain. when we die, our bodiesbecome the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. and so we are all connected in the great circle of life. good morning, sire! good morning, zazu. checking in with the morning report. fire away. well! the buzz from the bees is that the leopardsare in a bit of a spot. really?
