well, it's really personal. but i'm going to tell you because you're my best friend. it's about my mom. she works all night and takes care of us all day. and it just isn't fair. she acts like she's fine, but i know it's really hard for her. so i figured if anyone could fix that, it'd be santa. wow. and i just asked him for a turtle. mayor mcgerkle here we go! oh, it's starting. okay, who ville, it is time to light this beautiful tree. . , , and . okay, lock and load. all right, just attach this here and we'll be ready to launch. whines, barking i know! i wish i could see the look on their faces. whoa! whoa! okay. oh, boy! wow. that could be so much worse. let's begin the countdown. all ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. hey! my dragon can fly! .one! oh, my! no, no, no! no, no! whoa! wow! oh, it's beautiful. there it is, the most beautiful tree who ville has ever seen. no! no! no! no, no. narrator he walked through the crowd and the sound, and the lights. and his ears heard the thump of their joy and delights. and it took him right back to his earliest years, to that lost, lonely boy who cried all of those tears. that lost, lonely boy, isolated and sad with no home of his own, no mom and no dad. and as the grinch looked around, he felt downright scared as he remembered that christmas where nobody cared. where nobody showed, not even a flea, and there were no cards, no gifts, and no tree. lively chatter, laughter and as he watched other kids, one thing became clear, that this was the single worst day of the year. and now here it was, that day once again when he felt all those feelings he felt way back when. when he'd watch whos young and old all sit down to feast, and they'd feast, and they'd feast, and they'd feast, feast, feast, feast. they'd feast on who pudding, and rare who roast beast. which is something the grinch could not stand in the least. and then they'd do something he liked least of all. every who down in who ville, the tall and the small, would stand close together with christmas bells ringing. they'd stand hand in hand and the whos would start singing. they'll sing, and they'll sing, and they'll sing, sing, sing, sing. narrator yes, he couldn't recall without feeling the sting. so the grinch finally declared. i must stop this whole thing. why? for years i've put up with it. now. i must stop this christmas from coming, but how? narrator then he got an idea, an awful idea. the grinch got a wonderful, awful idea. i know just what to do. i'm going to steal their christmas. all the trimmings. all the trappings. all their gifts and garlands. when they wake and see it's gone then all their joy and happiness will be gone as well. so prepare yourself, max. for, tomorrow we begin. genius starts with the abs, max. it's go time. and now, the question we have all been waiting for. how will i steal christmas? well, prepare to have your little doggy mind blown. poof. ta da! that's right. i become santa claus. but instead of giving all the joy and happiness, i'll take it away. if he can deliver christmas to the whole world in one night, then i can certainly steal it from little old who ville. i mean, come on, what's santa have that i don't? that's hurtful. um, what are you doing with my bowling ball? chasing it. and you're taking it where? it's a secret. all right, but not without breakfast. catch. whoa, waffles, my favorite! thanks! see you guys later! here we go. hey, cindy lou! oh, hey there, mr. cubbins. ready. all right. let's go. hold on! both whoo! yeah! let's go, let's go. let's move. hang on! whoo! and dismount. so, what do we know?

but if they could all be happy, maybe he could be, too. what? narrator her head felt unsteady, and her heart was just sick. oh, no! it must be a joke or a prank, or a trick. who would do such a thing? who would stoop down this low? and then one little girl realized she might just know. , feet up, up the side of mount crumpit, the grinch rode with his load to the tip top to dump it. keep going. we're gonna make it. izzy oh, dear. what. what happened? where's the decorations? all the presents. aw, man! mom, it's my fault. what. what is? all of this. i trapped santa last night because i wanted to ask him to do something special for you. but i think i made him mad and that's why he stole everyone's christmas. no! no, no. no, honey, this isn't your fault. he didn't steal christmas, he just stole stuff. christmas is in here. and besides, i already have the greatest gift i could ever get. you. just one more shove. what's that?
