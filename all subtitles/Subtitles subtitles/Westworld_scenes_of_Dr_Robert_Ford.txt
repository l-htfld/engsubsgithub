 abernathy what are your drives tend to my herd look after my wife your final drive my daughter dolores of course that must protect the roars i am who i am because no way i wouldn't have it i wouldn't have it any other that after warner or no llores music the things you did that after that i have to help my batter he's got to get help very good mr. abernathy that's enough this behavior miles beyond the glitch here access your current bill is your name brows is the rose you say rose what is your itinerary to meet my maker well you're in luck and what you want to say to your maker i most i cannot call them dirty and i shall have such revenge's on you both the things i will do what they are you not know not but they will be the terrorists of the earth you don't know anymore do you you're in a prison of your own sins turn it off what the hell was that i don't know he's off script he didn't program any of those behaviors we've used this host in a number of different roles why not since i've been here he's been abernathy for years he was sheriff for a while before then before that the professor yes from a horror narrative called the dinner party he was leader of a group of cultists out of the desert who turned cannibal i'd like to quote shakespeare john donne gertrude stein admit the last one is a bit of an anachronism but i couldn't resist these are fragments of prior builds the reveries must be allowing him to access them new clothes for don bernard severe old work coming back to haunt us music music we retired the two hosts in question you taught me how to make them but not how hard it is to turn them off they can't play god without being acquainted with a devil for something else bothering yields but nod now that head of yours works the photograph alone couldn't have caused that level of damage to abernathy not without some other outside interference you think it's sabotage imagined someone's been diddling with our creations is the simplest solution huh mr. connors razor the problem bernard is that what you and i did is so complicated we practice witchcraft we speak the right words and we create life itself out of chaos remember vodka was a th century monk he can't help us now bernard he would have us burned at the stake music music music are you lost no just trade a bit too far from where i'm supposed to be same as you were imagine i'm holiday it's boring daddy said we could do as we please ah my father used to say that the only boring people get bored mine too i used to think it's only boring people who don't feel boredom so cannot conceive of it in others i'm taking walk you're welcome to join me if you like do or just climb to the top of a mountain daddy said we weren't allowed then tell me dad me and you know we are no weyland it seems hardly a fitting name for a place so full don't you see it perhaps you're not looking hard enough at what the town with the white church listen can't you hear its bell yes yes i can hear it yeah i thought you might you see what a bored mind can conjure how did you do that everything in this world is magic except to the magician music as you head home now tommy's know quite a bit i'm gonna come back here again i am music now music this storyline will make hieronymus bosch look like he was doodling kittens i have vivisection self cannibalism a special little something i call the hora boris now i don't want to appear in modest but this is the apex of what the park can provide all right miss anything interesting all most skilled guests will fight their ways to the outer limits of the park besting fearsome braves seducing new bar maidens befriending tragically ill fated sidekicks and of course like all our best narratives over the years our guests will have the privilege of getting to know the character they're most interested in themselves i present our guests next obsession odyssey on red river applause no sorry no i don't think so we you don't think is the point of it got a couple of cheap thrills some surprises but it's not enough it's not about giving the guests what you think they want and that simple anticipation ara elation their politics the guests don't return for the obvious things we do the garish things they come back because of the subtleties the details they come back because they discover something they imagine no one had ever noticed before something they fall in love with they're not looking for story that tells them who they are they already know who they are they here because they want a glimpse of who they could be really go music the only thing your story tells me mr. sizemore it's who you are music well isn't there anything you like about it in size of those boots music something you want to save mr. loekle the board sir this might ruffle some feathers he promised in the new storyline they should have won something i've been working on for some time music something quite original music music the coward dies a thousand deaths the valiant taste of death but wonders of course shakespeare never met a man quite like you teddy you've died at least a thousand times and yet it hasn't dulled your courage tell me is that all you aspire to did he there's a girl dolores better than i deserve but maybe someday soon we'll have the life we both been dreaming oh no you never will your job is not to protect dolores it's to keep her here to ensure that the guests find her if they want to best the stall the gunslinger and have their way with his girl tell me is it never occurred to you to run off with them i got some record interview before i can be with her is your mysterious backstory it's the reason for my visit do you know why it is mystery today because we never actually bothered to give you one just a formless guilt you will never atone for that perhaps this time you had a worthy story of origin would you like that any small part of my new narrative a fiction which like all great stories is rooted in truth starts in a time of war a world in flames with the villain called wet why whose why do you remember now today you know of course i remember why you look upon the face of true evil yeah i would forget claim to get hear the voice of god they started down near escalante army was sent to put down the natives bad business why it was a sergeant went missing while out on some maneuvers and came back a few weeks later some pretty strange ideas i was hoping to run something by you apologies i was chasing inspiration it's a tricky thing weaving the old into the new mean one moment baton answer why is this host cupboard i just after you didn't month feel cold or ashamed he wanted to cover his modesty was that it doesn't get cold doesn't feel ashamed doesn't feel a solitary thing that we haven't told it understand what can i do for naught i thought it best that we speak in private sir yeah i thought we'd agreed to put these questions to rest but we did but what if we misdiagnosed the original problem treated the symptom rather than the disease then the disease is still out there abernathy and walter were exhibiting other appearances beyond memory recall the previous builds they were hearing voices talking to someone mr. blue cognitive dissonance i agree except they were talking to the same imaginary person someone named arnold harder with due respect sir i'm not sure you've told me the entire truth about this situation sid said if the truth kanade we do here is complicated for three years where he lived here in the park refining the host before a single guest set foot inside myself a team of engineers and my partner you had a partner yeah when the legend becomes fact you print the legend my business partners were more than happy to scrub him from the records and i suppose i didn't discourage them his name was arnold those areas are glorious no guests no board meeting exist pure creation music house began to pass the turing test of the first year that there wasn't enough for arnold he he wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect of wit he wanted the real thing he wanted to create consciousness music he imagined it as a pyramid memory probe ization self interest and bet the top never got that but he had a notion of what it might be he based it on a theory of consciousness called the bicameral mind the idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be the voice of a gods and i thought it was debunked no it's the theory for understanding the human mind perhaps but not as a blueprint for building an artificial one she arnold built a version of their cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as a an inner monologue for the hopes that in time their own voice would take over there's a way to bootstrap consciousness but arnold hadn't considered two things one that in this place the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious and to the other group who considered their thoughts to be the voices of the gods lunatics indeed we abandon approach the only vestiges that remain are the voice commands we use to control them but for all his brilliance i don't think arnold understood what this place was going to be you see the guests enjoyed power they cannot indulge them the outside world so they come here does for the hosts the least we can do is make them forget but some of them are remembering accessing fragments of arnold's code if i may ask what happened to him well he died here in the park his personal life was marked by tragedy he put all his hopes into his work his search for consciousness consumed him totally barely spoke to anyone except to the hosts in his alienation he saw something in them he saw something that wasn't there we called it an accident but um i knew arnold he was very very careful anyway the update should prevent any further voices but you will let me know if any of the hosts display or exhibit any unusual behavior won't you bernard oh yes of course kurt don't bernard just don't forget the hosts are not real they're not conscious you mustn't make honest mistake why would i well forgive me but i know that the death of your son charlie still weighs heavily on you music after neighbors trained safe to say they're asking questions rocks prefer not move we shall move to me with that narrative you're creating is clearly a massive endeavor if you need more time i'm sure the board would be happy to oblige i'm sure they'd be happier for me to delay it indefinitely come with me you imagine i've gone mad lost my way we're simply concerned about the extent of the changes you're making you want to protect your legacy my legacy you don't like this place very much do you i've seen many of you come and go over the years and i can tell the ones who enjoy their time here and the ones who don't i admire it the audacity of it oh i forgotten how beautiful it is i came there once as a child with my parents i think we even sat at this table oh maybe maybe that one when i started working here i realized this place wasn't something i would enjoy in the beginning i imagined things would be perfectly balanced even had a bet with my partner arnold to that effect he made a hundred hopeful storylines of course almost no one took us up on them i lost the bet arnold always held a somewhat dim view of people he preferred the host he begged me not to let you people in the money men tell us but i told him it'd be fine that you didn't understand what you were paying for it's not a business venture not a theme park but in the entire world we designed every inch of it every blade of grass and here we were cards you i'm here the our guests music and how did that work out for arnold sadly he lost his perspective he went mad i haven't as you oh no i have always seen things very clearly this is the table i sat on with my parents this is the cherry saturn we know everything about our guests don't be as we know everything about our employees i do hope he will be careful with bernard he has a sensitive disposition i beg your pardon senator there have been many of you over the years and we have always almost always found a way to make it work so i will ask you nicely please don't get in my way music the board will agree with me they'll be sending a representative but they already have i thought they would have told you that won't be necessary but no not anymore you can join the others you can tell the board that my narrative will be completed on time and it won't be a retrospective as i'm sure you are all fear i'm not the sentimental type you got any stories friend yeah i suppose i do want to know the saddest thing ever saw when i was boy i brought that and i wanted a dog so our father took in an old greyhound never seen greyhound oviatt film scene if his showdowns in my day a greyhound is a racing dog spends its life running in circles chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit one day we took into the park and dad had warned us how fast the talk was but we couldn't resist so my brother took off the leash and in that instant the dark spotted a cat imagined it must have looked just like their piece of felt he ran never saw a thing as beautiful as that whole tug running until at last he finally caught it and to the horror of everyone he killed that lady at torah the pieces that he just said they're confused that dog had spent his whole life trying to catch that see now it had no idea what to do and his one alone deng erm story partner shall we drink to the lady with the wet shoes music hello dolores do you know where you are i'm in a dream yes dolores you're in my dream tell me do you know what this dream means dreams are the mind tells stories to itself they don't mean anything no dreams mean everything they're the stories we tell ourselves of what could be who we could become have you been dreaming again dolores imagining ourselves breaking out of your mother's little loop taking on a bigger role well i suppose i can't begrudge it had my father told me to be satisfied with my lot in life that the world owed me nothing and so i made my own world tell me dolores do you remember the man i used to be i'm sorry i'm forgetful sometimes hardly our fault i'm sure you remember him arnold the person who created you i'm sorry i don't think i recall anyone by that name and yet you can somewhere under all those updates you still there perfectly preserved your mind is a walled garden even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there have you been hearing voices as arnold been speaking to you again you're you're hurting me analysis when was your last contact with arnold last contact years days hours ago yes to norris the day arnold i and you have no records of any contact with him since you know it was the last thing he said to you he told me i was going to help him help him do what to destroy this place but you didn't did you you've been content in your little loop for the most part i wonder if you did take on that bigger role for yourself would you have been the hero or the villain that's enough to lure us i'm sorry for bothering you but there's no one else left who was there no one who understands as we understand are we very old friends no i wouldn't say friends dolores i wouldn't say that at all music music he doesn't know i didn't tell him anything those are little you boys want some company music this donation must be running low short on time need to buck up teddy i told you no company little might join you anyway well isn't this a rare honor teddy you know this is i can't say that i do if you claims good that has ever happened in your life and everything rotten this is the man you have the thing how am i doing robert any closer to finding what i'm looking for and what is that exactly looking for a man named wyatt kill the rash for back in sweetwater good daughter that last part doesn't sound familiar figured your stories could use a little embellishment and i always felt this place was missing a real villain hence my humble contribution i admit i lack the imagination to even conceive of someone like evil the urgency however doesn't quite fit the character it betrays a certain anxiety now wyatt on the other hand that's something dude is he just another stooge for the tourist amount on their wall at home or have you finally made a worthy adversary someone to stop me from finding the center of the maze what is it you're hoping to find the you know why you exist study the world out there the one you'll never see was one of plenty fat soft teeth people cling to their entire life every need taken care of except one purpose meaning until they come bigger they can be a little scared little throw enjoy some sweetly affirmative and na you take a picture and they go back home but i think there's deeper meaning hiding under all that something that person who created it like to express something true if you're looking for the moral of the story quite simply ask i need a shovel man i'd be asking died years ago almost took this place with him almost but not quite thanks to me well maybe he left something behind i won't do what i would find if i open you up music even a death store still loyal pet music is that why you came here rough talk me out on the contrary far be it from me to get in the way of her voyage of self discovery mr. flood we must look back and smile at pearls past music we should get back on the road time's wasting music music music so if you want the canyon to extend this far this has to go we can distribute the population amongst the neighboring farms or just decommission them no i think we've been disruptive enough for one day we lend the canyon just short of the top i find my own way back hell music music music music are you arnold who's arnold and who the hell are you boy it's a cell friend of yours with you're trespassin freeze motor functions lost in someone else's property time him that's enough as you were they don't respond to voice commands you to respond to mine who are they ghosts now survivors of the wreck of time these are first generation mm hmm i'm here boy music send out the cheek so what are new designs gained and efficiency they lost in greece how are they still operating after all this time i maintained myself that's nothing these are the only ones left in the park that arnold built himself that's why i didn't have the heart to destroy them that and the obvious hello jock good boy i told him of a holiday my family take months hurtin see senator pat dean and cornwall my brother and i roamed the countryside is my only happy memory of my childhood now on builtin is a gift he said the great artists always hid themselves in their work of course arnold's versions flattered the originals i made some adjustments over the years gave my father in particular a few of his original characteristics music respectfully sir this sort of thing troubles me unmonitored hosts in the park the only go i've let them they're quite harmless i call a host i'm sure you can entice me that little connection with my past you could only see our son again bernard would you want music i think i should be getting back yes talk about the state if you like oh robert tell me all about your day music are you lost on the contrary i thought we could play catch with jock did you bring him where is he boy music i don't want you to worry about jock fix him but i need you to tell me what happened it it saw a rabbit and a brown i found it like that analysis are you lying to me boy yes tell me what really happened to it i killed it why i don't know that's not good enough robert tell me what happened what the rabbits haven't killed it then someone told me to put it out of its misery who told you a voice whose voice ahnold he told me i was a killer it wasn't its fault was made that way and i could help it help it music if it was dead it couldn't hurt anything anymore as hell i was not aware those with our level of insight needed any more reflection dr. ford always charming what is this apparently is coming and miss hale have a presentation for us what about following the recent reports of host malfunction we asked you a to check the last abortive update which featured the reveries as i believe they're called hmm i'm sorry to report the miss cullen and her team uncovered some worries and findings in the course of our code review we found something quite disturbing wake her up we said clementine pennyfeather back to a previous update when we discovered the build was buggy due to the last minute injunction of the reverie code we quickly rolled all the infected hosts back to their prior build you not much of a ride on you all right that's not breathe as you've no doubt gathered i take is in fact a host one that has been coded for the purposes of this simulation to read as a human and as you can see behavioral safeguards are operating exactly as you would expect we set her quite a memory okay let's do this again you're new not much variety music music music that's enough sweetheart freeze all motor functions freeze all motor functions freeze all motor functions in each case we examined the malfunctioning hose for not resetting properly attention of data that hadn't been wiped overloaded their decision making apparatus eventually causing a system failure that allowed for override of their primary rules set the concern with the reveries is that the host will remember some of their experiences and act on them you're telling us that these hosts were responding to a grudge that's exactly what i'm saying is alone and funny you should use that particular word grudge since what was most troubling to me was that several texts and behavior voice these exact same concerns to the head of their department you put this code out without proper vetting and without reasonable understanding of its ramifications so either you didn't write it or you getting sloppy to the point risking the lives of our guests few things surprised me anymore mr. lowe but this level of negligence is breathtaking we are way beyond rollback territory within the next six months we'll need to rebuild those from the ground up you want us to lobotomize them is what you're saying no not you mr
