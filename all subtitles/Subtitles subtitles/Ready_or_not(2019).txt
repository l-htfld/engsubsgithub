no. you just. you just have to play. and then. and then you. you are officially part of the family. honestly, it means more to them than the wedding itself. that's it? yeah, that's it. i know it's ridiculous. it's just a weird family ritual. and we only have to do it once. all right?

oh. thank you. thanks. my foster parents were great people. and, you know, they did what they could. but it was always temporary. i always sort of dreamed of having a. a family. i mean, i'm sure alex would've loved living in sin forever. i don't doubt it. but he, um, he really understood how important it was for me to. finally have a real, permanent family. and i just don't wanna let you down. grace. when i first saw you, i said to tony finally. one of our children has brought home a good one. and you don't know how grateful we are that you brought alex back to us. but please. try to bring him back into the fold. we're his family. i promise. oh, sweetheart. i knew you would. oh! hey. hi! mom, i'm just gonna steal her away. okay?

um, i guess it depends on what we're playing. well, we'll know in a moment. i gather you've noticed our family is big on tradition. and now, well, now the time has come for you to join us in those traditions. ooh. story time. as you may know, my great grandfather, victor, set up a modest printing shop during the civil war, manufacturing playing cards. a generation later, my grandfather expanded into sporting goods and board games. under my leadership, le domas family games acquired four professional sports teams and reached, well, even greater heights. some may call it luck, but, well, it's a little more than that. you know, it's almost as if someone's watching over us. it all began with a very generous benefactor. and this box. you see, originally, great grandfather was a merchant seaman. it was a hard life. and, like so many, he wanted more. on one of his many excursions abroad, great grandfather came to meet a mr. le bail. he was a. he was a passenger aboard the ship. a collector, of sorts. purchasing exotic antiquities to resell to wealthy americans. after discovering a mutual passion for games of chance, they passed a great many hours playing cards. and among mr. le bail's possessions was. that box. and one evening, after indulging in more than their fair ration of rum. mr. le bail proposed a wager. if great grandfather could solve the mystery of the box before arriving at port, mr. le bail would finance any endeavor of grandfather's choosing. well. great grandfather whiled away the long hours at sea studying the box. until finally. and since that time. whenever the le domases are presented with a new addition to the family. we place a blank playing card into the box. our initiate then has the privilege of drawing the card, and mr. le bail will tell us which game to play. i got chess. i got old maid. seriously, what the fuck is old maid? fitch. so i just take out the card? my dear, it is your turn. what does it say, girl? oh. it says. it says, hide and seek. are we really gonna play that? everything okay? uh. yeah. yeah. those are the rules. hide and seek, right, dad? yes, indeed. those are the rules. okay, so, uh, who. who hides and who seeks? well, it's your initiation, my dear. you get to be the one to, uh, to hide. of course. this is gonna be fun, honey. yeah, just come meet me in my room, okay? no, i wanna play for real. this is so weird. no, no. i know. um, so, to mister. le bail. to mr. le bail. to mr. le bail. to mr. le bail. the rules are simple. you can hide anywhere inside the house. we then count to and try to, um. well, find you. well, don't you think you have a little bit of an advantage? oh. no, no. we never use the cameras. we always play the games as they would've been played in great grandfather's time. always. so, there's no way for me to win, right? well, you could, i mean, stay hidden till dawn. no, thank you. no. we're gonna start the count just as soon as you leave, okay? okay. grace, good luck. who wants to play a game? it's time for hide and seek. run, run, run time to run and hide run, run, run here we may reign secure. and now i'm going to find you .and in my choice .to reign is worth ambition. hurry, i'm behind you don't you speak hide and seek tiptoe to the cellar or crawl under your bed anywhere you've fled i am going to find you stay inside the shadows all you girls and boys don't you make a noise or i am going to find you run, run, run creep up on my prey run, run, run stalk the night away you can scuttle off into the night but what will be behind you don't you speak hide and seek like the frog inside a skillet the lobster in a pan you don't understand that i am going to find you be still as a mountain and quiet as a mouse tony, what the hell is this? how old is this thing? and i will surely find you tick, tick, tock are you ready or not tick, tick, tock listen to the clock hasten off into the black don't waste another heartbeat don't you peek hide and seek let the countdown begin. ten, nine, eight even, six, five four, three, two, one ready or not, here i come. sweetheart, maybe you should just stay here. watch the door. thank you, charity. so, how was your wedding night, grace? oh. it was just great. just great. i, uh. i sat in a dumbwaiter. alex, honey, do you want some company? oh, fuck me. how long is this gonna take? how long does this usually take? there is nothing usual about this. it's only happened once since i joined the family. am i really supposed to know how to use this thing?

no. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. are you fucking serious? shh. we could've eloped. i know. we could've. no, no. there are rules. you can't just elope. you. you have to have the wedding here, and you have to play the fucking game. you didn't even fucking talk to me. you could've told me. we could've. just. if i told you, you would've left. and if i didn't propose, you would've left. you're everything to me, and i promise you i'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

you didn't fucking blink. i mean, you couldn't wait to sign your soul away. you know where i came from and what my life was like before. i'd rather be dead than lose all of this. well. from your lips. where is she? i'm afraid you just missed her. tony, alex got out. i'm so sorry. goddammit. who's the fuckup now, right? still me? did you find her? is it over? no, it's not over. and now she knows what's going on. oh, but emilie shot clara in the face. so she's dead. that's just a side note. clara's dead?

he and i have always been so much alike. i knew the girl would draw that card, and that he would face the same choice i faced. horse shit. none of us expected to be doing this tonight. i got a tee time at eight. and, in case you didn't notice, it wasn't much of a choice for him. he's been helping her from the get go. he hates us. no. he's simply afraid of who he truly is. like i was. you'll never know how it felt that night to be told that the only man that i'd ever loved had to die. but i should not have fought it. i should have killed charles myself. there's still time for alex to do the right thing. he only has to accept the truth. uh, um, what truth is that? that he is meant to lead this family, not run from it. he's hated our pact from the very start. he's the good son. do you remember that? then why is he the only one of us who has ever seen mr. le bail in his chair?

oh, i don't know, mom. i don't know. maybe one night when i was chanting and slicing the throat of a goat, it occurred to me that that wasn't a completely normal thing to do. but, and this is what scared me the most. it felt normal. it did. and i realized that you'll do pretty much anything. if your family says it's okay. and then i met grace. she's the opposite of all of you. she's good. and she made me feel like i could be good too. so, if it comes down to you or her, i choose her. i don't believe you. and i don't think that you believe that a girl that you've known for a year and a half. knows you better than i do. our family has a very special friend named mr. le bail. mr. le bail is the reason we have all the nice things we have. but sometimes mr. le bail wants something from us in return. you got this, fitch. you got this, fitch! don't be a bitch, fitch. don't be a bitch, fitch. you got this, bitch. i know tonight didn't go as planned. but i'll make it right, mr. le bail. you'll see. we renew our pledge this night, as our ancestors before us. with this offering of living flesh and blood. hail. brother! poisoned! you son of a bitch! oh, god. what did you give us?
