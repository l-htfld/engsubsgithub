 it's not nothing. it's always something. didn't dad teach you to tie nail knots? why would he do that? he only ever used a fisherman's knot. one knot. no, he didn't. no, he tied at least three. clinch knots? no way. fine, i'm making it up. reel clicking did dad teach you mostly dry lures? yeah. you? wet. you're kidding. but he was always so adamant. i mean, you know dad on the fishing thing. gee, you think? i only spent my entire childhood with my ass in a boat. but in my day it was all about getting the hook seated. we were fishing for the dinner table. not us. we always threw them back. always. i guess he changed things up. but that'd be like changing his religion or something. people change. it's not his fault we were born years apart. no. no, because the minute you went off to college it was my ass in that boat and he taught me dry lures from day one. this was not behavior developed over time. reel clicks you think he did it for us? crying because he knew we were so different. chuckles he knew that you needed to catch the fish and i needed to throw them back. inhales all right, remember his rule no crying in the boat. it scares the fish. mom and dad i mean, maybe florida wasn't hit so bad. maybe it's better there. do you think? reel clicks, whirrs i think you have a bite. even with the wrong knots. reel clicking sniffles oh god. sighs so much for the no crying rule. i think that was more for dad than the fish. shovel scraping theme music playing shouts i won't hesitate. i don't care if every walker in the city hears it. you got a do rag or something? sighs i guess the saw blade was too dull for the handcuffs. ain't that a bitch. he must have used a tourniquet maybe his belt. be much more blood if he didn't. merle? you in here? jim? you okay? you keep this up, you're gonna keel over out here. drink some water at least. growling thuds daryl had enough in him to take out these two sumbitches one handed. toughest asshole i ever met, my brother. grunts feed him a hammer, he'd crap out nails. any man can pass out from blood loss, no matter how tough he is. morales oh, baby. will you look at that?

screw that. he could be bleeding out. you said so yourself. glenn what's that burned stuff? skin. he cauterized the stump. told you he was tough. nobody can kill merle but merle. don't take that on faith. he's lost a lot of blood. yeah? didn't stop him from busting out of this death trap. he left the building? why the hell would he do that? daryl why wouldn't he? he's out there alone as far as he knows, doing what he's got to do. surviving. t dog you call that surviving? just wandering out in the streets, maybe passing out? what are his odds out there? no worse than being handcuffed and left to rot by you sorry pricks. you couldn't kill him. ain't so worried about some dumb dead bastard. what about , dumb dead bastards? different story? why don't you take a tally? do what you want. i'm gonna go get him. daryl, wait. get your hands off me! you can't stop me. i don't blame you. he's family, i get that. i went through hell to find mine. i know exactly how you feel. he can't get far with that injury. we could help you check a few blocks around but only if we keep a level head. i could do that. only if we get those guns first. i'm not strolling the streets of atlanta with just my good intentions, okay? hey, jim. jim, why don't you hold up, all right? just give me a second here, please. what do you want? we're all just a little concerned, man. that's all. dale says you've been out here for hours. so?

they're gonna cut off my feet, carnal. cops do that? not him. this redneck puto here. he cut off some dude's hand, man. he showed it to me. shut up. hey, that's that vato right there. he shot me in the ass with an arrow. what's up, homes, huh? chill, ese, chill. chill. this true? he wants miguelito's feet? that's pretty sick, man. we were hoping more for a calm discussion. that hillbilly jumps felipe's little cousin, beats on him, threatens to cut off his feet, felipe gets an arrow in the ass and you want a calm discussion? you fascinate me. heat of the moment. mistakes were made on both sides. who's that dude to you anyway? you don't look related. he's one of our group, more or less. i'm sure you have a few like him. daryl you got my brother in there? guillermo sorry, we're fresh out of white boys. but i've got asian. you interested? i have one of yours, you have one of mine. sounds like an even trade. don't sound even to me. g. come on, man. guillermo my people got attacked. where's the compensation for their pain and suffering? more to the point, where's my bag of guns? guns? the bag miguel saw in the street. the bag felipe and jorge were going back to get. that bag of guns. you're mistaken. i don't think so. rick about it being yours. it's my bag of guns. the bag was in the street. anybody could come around and say it was theirs. i'm supposed to take your word? what's to stop my people from unloading on you right here and now and i take what's mine? you could do that. or not. come on, man. make the trade. please. oye. whimpers guillermo i see two options. you come back with miguel and my bag of guns, everybody walks. or you come back locked and loaded, we'll see which side spills more blood. clacking them guns are worth more than gold. gold won't protect your family or put food on the table. you willing to give that up for that kid? t dog if i knew we'd get glenn back, i might agree. but you think that vato across the way is just gonna hand him over? you calling g a liar? are you a part of this? you want to hold onto your teeth? question is, do you trust that man's word? daryl no, question is what are you willing to bet on it? could be more than them guns. could be your life. glenn worth that to you? what life i have i owe to him. i was nobody to glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank. he could have walked away, but he didn't. neither will i. so you're gonna hand the guns over? i didn't say that. there's nothing keeping you two here. you should get out, head back to camp. and tell your family what? come on, this is nuts. just do like g says. door clacking i see my guns but they're not all in the bag. that's because they're not yours. i thought i mentioned that. let's just shoot these fools right now, ese. all right? unload on their asses, ese. i don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation. no, i'm pretty clear. you have your man. i want mine. i'm gonna chop up your boy. i'm gonna feed him to my dogs. they're the evilest, nastiest man eating bitches you ever saw. i picked them up from satan at a yard sale. i told you how it has to be. are you woefully deaf? no, my hearing's fine. you said come locked and loaded. okay then, we're here. woman felipe! felipe! abuela, go back with the others now. get that old lady out of the line of fire! abuela, listen to your m'hijo, okay? this is the not the place for you right now. mr. gilbert is having trouble breathing. he needs his asthma stuff. carlito didn't find it. he needs his medicine. felipe, go take care of it, okay? and take your grandmother with you. felipe speaks spanish who are those men? felipe speaks spanish don't you take him. ma'am? felipe's a good boy. he have his trouble but he pull himself together. we need him here. ma'am, i'm not here to arrest your grandson. then what do you want him for?

an asthma attack. couldn't get his breath all of a sudden. i thought you were being eaten by dogs, man. barks could i have a word with you? you're the dumbest son of a bitch i ever met. we walked in there ready to kill every last one of you. well, i'm glad it didn't go down that way. if it had, that blood would be on my hands. mine too. we'd have fought back. wouldn't be the first time we've had to. protect the food, the medicine what's left of it. these people, the old ones the staff took off, just left em here to die. me and felipe were the only ones who stayed. what are you, doctors? felipe's a nurse a special care provider. me, i'm the custodian. what about the rest of your crew? the vatos trickle in to check on their parents, their grandparents. they see how things are and most decide to stay. it's a good thing too. we need the muscle. the people we've encountered since things fell apart, the worst kind plunderers, the kind that take by force. that's not who we are. guillermo how was i to know? my people got attacked and you show up with miguel hostage appearances. guess the world changed. guillermo no. it's the same as it ever was. the weak get taken. so we do what we can here. the vatos work on those cars, talk about getting the old people out of the city. but most can't even get to the bathroom by themselves, so that's just a dream. still, it keeps the crew busy, and that's worth something. so we barred all the windows, welded all the doors shut except for one entrance. the vatos, they go out, scavenge what they can to keep us going. we watch the perimeter night and day and we wait. the people here, they all look to me now. i don't even know why. because they can. glenn admit it, you only came back to atlanta for the hat. rick don't tell anybody. daryl you've given away half our guns and ammo. rick not nearly half. daryl for what? bunch of old farts who are gonna die off momentarily anyhow? seriously, how long you think they got? how long do any of us? glenn oh my god. where the hell's our van? we left it right there. who would take it? merle. he's gonna be taking some vengeance back to camp. wrapping paper, color tissue, anything? dale seriously? how can you not have any? had i been informed of the impending apocalypse i'd have stocked up. it's amy's birthday tomorrow. i've been marking days on the calendar just to make sure. you don't give a gift unwrapped. deep breath. i'm sure i'll find something here. i, uh, built up the rocks all around. see? so the flames can be a little higher and have em be hidden. hey, jim. how you feeling, man? i'm better. more myself now. i hope you understand the need for this this timeout. i've got others i've got to think about. i just want to make sure there's no there's no hard feelings. there's not. i do understand. okay. chuckles why don't you come join in with the rest of us? big ol' fish fry. i'd like that very much. shane okay. plastic rustles why don't you come outside with everybody? hell with them people. wouldn't piss on them if their heads was on fire. hey! why don't you stay here?

that watch. what's wrong with my watch? i see you every day, the same time, winding that thing like a village priest saying mass. i've wondered this myself. i'm missing the point. jacqui unless i've misread the signs, the world seems to have come to an end. at least hit a speed bump for a good long while. but there's you every day winding that stupid watch. time it's important to keep track, isn't it? the days at least. don't you think, andrea? back me up here. chuckles i like i like what, um, a father said to son when he gave him a watch that had been handed down through generations. he said, i give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire, which will fit your individual needs no better than it did mine or my father's before me i give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you may forget it for a moment now and then and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it. you are so weird. all laugh it's not me. it's faulkner. william faulkner. maybe my bad paraphrasing. where are you going? i have to pee. jeez, you try to be discreet around here laughs rustling thought i told y'all to leave me the hell alone, didn't i? hey! what'd i say? growling oh! we're out of toilet paper? growling gasps, screaming people screaming carl mom! lori carl! lori, get him down! guns firing oh my god. t dog go! go! woman, children screaming lori i'm right here. shane, what do we do?
