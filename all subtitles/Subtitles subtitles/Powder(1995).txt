the baby, i'm concerned, might have some abnormalities. outwardly, we can already tell that the child has no pigmentation. it's called albinism. it's strictly genetic. that's, that's. well, that's pale skin, right? and pale eyes that are usually more light sensitive. i want to see him. greg, you have to remember that an unborn child experiences everything that the mother experiences. you take me to him. you show me. doctor we'll do everything we can for him, greg. you know that. greg what are you doing to him?

i'm guessing that's what it is. the old man here died last night. the neighbors found him this morning. we figure the kid's his grandson. so where is he? he won't come up from the cellar. he didn't report his grandfather's death either. we already know he died of natural causes. doug, what am i doing here? the neighbors say he may be retarded. one of them says deformed. you know, physically handicapped. i don't know. i couldn't for the life of me think of who else to call. he's scared enough, and i thought maybe you could come down and talk him out of there without us having to go down and drag him out. jessie, the neighbors talk about him like he's some kind of a phantom. i haven't met one yet that ever had a good look at him. what are you telling me, doug? that the old folks may have kept him down there, like some kind of a family secret. i don't know. boy? i brought somebody to talk to you. hello? hey, my name is jessie. are you okay down here? you think we could turn a light on? hey, if you're afraid, you don't need to be. not with me. boy i'm not afraid. what's your name? powder. is that a name or a nickname? he was getting coffee and he fell. he just. he just fell over and died. i tried to help him. i tried. he. doug we know that. son, i told you, you're not in any trouble. i'm sorry. i just want to see you. why?

anything. sheriff? we'll be all right. be right back. why didn't you tell anyone when you knew he was dead? why didn't you call the police? grandpa said there would be a day when he would die, like grandma died, and that people would come and see me and try and take me away. get back there. keep an ear, but don't go down. yes, sir. lucy, this is barnum. lucy go ahead, sheriff. i'm here. we're still out at the reeds'. we got something out here nobody's gonna believe. you don't live down here? mmm. i do most of the work around the place. at least until the sun gets too high. then the sunglasses don't even help. did you know they make contact lenses now that can protect your eyes from the sun all the time? i read about them, but grandpa said they cost too much. when's the last time you were in school? i've never been to school. i read about it though. but you said you read all these books? have you read this book? well, i know college kids who couldn't wade through this one. pick a page. two hundred and sixteen. where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more. in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary? where is the foundling's father hidden? our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them. and the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it. you know the whole book? i know 'em all. go clear 'em back. all right, everybody, let's move back. and i mean back beyond the vehicles. let's go! it's all right. you don't have to be afraid. you're afraid. you're afraid for me. why don't you get in here? i'll take that. harley you ever see so many goddamn lightning rods on one house? i just got off the horn with the coroner. he said that old boy died of natural causes, but there was evidence of fibrillation. his body was juiced with electricity. that old man was laying dead there all night. you think the paramedics showed up this morning and tried paddles on him? are you telling me the kid electrocuted the old man? what do you think, he's dr. frankenstein? i'm just sayin' that that's more than an albino, doug. that is spooky. i never thought we'd find a man too white for you there, harley. down! set! hut! jessie don't let 'em fool you. they spend most their time tryin' to look tough. you get to know 'em, you find out they're mostly scared and lonely, just like everybody else. hut! what the hell is that? you need to see him, aaron, to know what i'm saying. you need to see him sitting out in the hall right now, 'cause i'm telling you, i've never seen anything like him. that's exactly what i mean. because of the way he's lived. uh, he doesn't seem to know what things are. i mean, things you and i take for granted, common, everyday objects, simple ideas. i just don't think he's ever been exposed to them. i mean, he's about the most well read teenage kid you could ever meet, but in other ways. i think he's a lot like a little child. why you look like that? you look like some kind of vampire from outer space or something. they kick you out of cancer camp? you got some kind of disease? don't look at me, man. did you hear what i said? i don't like your eyes. what's a new guy gotta do the first day he gets here? he's gotta do the due. new guy, first day, first meal. he's gotta wear his spoon. you ever wear your spoon? well, you got two choices. you can either wear it on the end of your nose. why don't you show, mitch? now, you can wear it like that, or you can wear it the other way, which is up your ass. you choose. what are you doin'? poppa. you see steven? he stayed three hours. did her more good than them painkillers. she was hurtin' all day till he got here. he brought her that, too. what happened out at the reed farm today? i'm here, angel. something about a retarded boy they got up at the state home now. how the hell did you hear about that? i guess i don't have to tell you what i think about that. i'd love it if you didn't. the last thing we need up there is another mental defective along with all that other trash. here you go. i don't know what he is, but retarded he's not. well, aside from the absence of any and all body hair, which is a condition not too uniquely uncommon, bottom line, he's a very healthy young man. in fact, with all that farm work, i'd say you're in damn fine shape. and the optometrist said his contact lenses will be here the end of the week? they'll be callin' him ol' blue eyes in time for the county fair. you guys are comin', right? uh, you'll see a few of us there. hey, doc, thanks for comin' out. it's my pleasure. good day, mr. jeremy reed. jeremy, listen, uh, i want you to think about something. we attend school in town at wheaton high. you certainly wouldn't be at an intellectual disadvantage there, and i know most of the teachers, so. anyway, um, all i'm saying is, if you'd like to attend school one day next week, i can arrange it. will my contacts be ready by monday? boy hey, hey, guys. molecules. when we speed up the course of molecules, we get. .energy. and, um, since we are all basically just a mass of molecules, what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body? lindsey? um, impulses. yeah. electric impulses. jeremy, turn your head and look at lindsey. yes. that's lovely. that's very good. you've just relayed electricity. your brain sent out an electric impulse down to your neck muscles and, uh, what, what turned your head, besides the obvious? what your, what your muscles used to turn your head? it's energy. energy. always relaying, always transforming and never ending. now, looky here. this is a, uh, a jacob's ladder. it's a science fair toy, and it's, uh, built to show us how electricity travels. okay? can we get the, uh, shutters? watch this. students ooh! hey, cut it out. cut it out. ripley ooh, look at this. blinding, isn't it? now, who can tell me why electricity travels? uh, boredom? huh, he tickles me. no. no, potential. potential. one side of this thing is positive, while the other side has a strong negative pull. and, uh, that's all the potential that electricity needs to travel. that's right. that's pretty good. don't i bring you good, entertaining things? but you get the idea that it does. you know, it travels and just keeps going. did you ever. what's your experience with electricity? did you ever, you know, run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody? what happens? static electricity? that's right, that's right. now, where does it go when you touch somebody? it just goes out. so. so, so electricity, like energy, uh, just, um, uh, recycles. it flows in a cycle that doesn't end. it, uh. are you all right? mr. ripley? are you okay? harley the local news and those channel people are outside. so is jimmy hobbs from the newspaper. tell them to go home. oh, come on, doug. they ain't goin' anywhere till somebody goes out there and talks to 'em. tell them there's no fatalities, no sex scandal. that will get rid of them fast. god damn it, doug, i sound like a moron if i say more than five words to those people, and you know it. well, if the shoe fits. duane but i can't do it. i've got no authorization to do anything. i can't let you go anywhere. doug hi, doc. here we go, here we go. doug, doug, tell duane that it's okay for me to see that kid. thank you. donald, you're just the man i wanted to see. i got different kids telling me different stories. right. uh, if i hadn't seen it myself, i'd say it was impossible. it was a model. for god sakes, it picked him right out of his seat. what did? hold it! hold it, doug. the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. heart rate's a little irregular, but nothing to indicate the kind of electrical shock you're talking about. right, right! and he's got a hole, uh, burned in his shirt the size of a bowling ball. something's happened here. something's happened here. i'm telling you, with everything we know about science, about the makeup of the human body, what happened in that classroom is impossible! that kid attracted an arc of electricity from feet away. and not just from the jacob's ladder. i mean, after a second, it was like it was comin' at him out of the whole. building. you want to know why there isn't a hair on him? doug why? because he is electrolysis. it can't grow on him. nurse doc roth? yes? can i see you for a minute? excuse me. nurse excuse me. drink that in. doug i will. nobody saw him leave his room, but his clothes are gone too. find him. he can't have gotten far. lucy, come in. hey. zack! zachary! zack, come here. come here, boy. whoa, whoa, whoa. watch out. he bites. the family before us made him pretty mean, so. wow, i can't believe i'm looking at you. are you okay? i didn't mean to scare anybody. the whole thing was pretty embarrassing really. embarrassing? you're kidding, right? my grandma used to say i have an electric personality. well, that was some light show. i mean, people will be talking about that to their grandkids' grandkids around here. i don't mean to stare, but i had a bet with a friend that you have blue gray eyes. she says they're blue green. looks like she's right. well, actually. you're both wrong. oh. sorry. no, no, that's okay. just kind of took me by surprise, that's all. oh, well. lindsey you must feel like you've got two heads, the way everybody looks at you around here, huh? have you ever listened to people from the inside? listened so close, you can hear their thoughts and all their memories? hear 'em think from places that they don't even know they think from? what, are you saying you can do that? are you sure you're okay? do you know how to get to the interstate? yeah, it's, um. if you follow the train tracks, you'll see the redmond water tower. then, if you go across the trestle, you'll see it. but you're really okay? i'm okay. you better hurry. they catch boys running away from central, i hear they get solitary. hey! stay away from those electrical outlets, okay? bye. if i didn't know better, i'd say you were headed for the highway. don't make me come out there, boy. now, you're about to make me a whole lot meaner. trust me, son, you don't want to make me mad. afraid. i don't make you mad, i make you afraid. what was that? i said that you're afraid of me. duncan, get on back. i can handle this. i'm all right. i can see that. then let me go home. i don't want to go back to that hospital. we'll call the doc. if he says okay, i'll take you back to central. central's not my home. doug i'm trying to tell you as nice as i know how. now either you come with me without a fuss, or we're gonna have ourselves a problem. you want me to cuff him? lucy, this is one. we got him. i'm coming back to the office. lucy doug. you got a problem with hospitals in general? i don't like 'em. well, you can put me on that list. worst day i can remember was in a hospital. what day was that? the day i was born. let me get this straight, jeremy. you said that you've never been tested for iq before. is that right? and your grandmother tutored you. did she ever say anything about it? she said i was a fast learner. yeah. well, i think that's about to fall into the no shit category. jeremy reed, this is dr. aaron stipler with the state board of education. jeremy. jessie these men and women are here because the results of your diagnostics came back with a few surprises. please, sit down. miss caldwell says you're a very unique young man, jeremy. hmm. she also tells me that, um, reading and your grandparents are the only ways you've experienced the world. is that true? what about a radio or, um, a tv set? surely you've watched some television at some point? he probably couldn't. didn't your grandparents have a tv set, jeremy? i could never watch television. are you saying you weren't allowed? here, it probably just makes. no. oh! i'm saying i could never watch television. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. that was. that was my fault. i, uh. i was just trying to make them understand. what the good doctor hasn't let you in on yet is that your test shows that you're a genius. stipler please! your iq scored right off the charts, jeremy. there isn't even a classification for you, it was so high. all of your tests indicate that you have the most advanced intellect in the history of humankind. do you understand what i'm saying? if you thought i was that advanced, would you ask me if i understood? jeremy, these people are in a position to help you. can they send me home? can they send me back? no. i'm sorry. they can't. the fact is, the. the farm's in probate. do you know what that means? of or pertaining to probate or a court of probate, exempli gratia, the official proving of a will as authentic or genuine. or it can also mean the official, certified copy of a will so proved. right. well, it seems that the bank owns most of it. i'm sorry. well, back to the matter at hand. i have a few more questions i have to ask you, jeremy. you're not here to ask me questions. you're here to find out how i cheated. that's the only way you can make sense of it. that's what you need to believe. but i don't need you to believe in me, dr. stipler. and i'm not interested in any of your tests. i'm not interested in you, or anything else here. i'm interested in going home! what the hell is going on here? what you already know. i'm not like other people. what the hell is that thing doing up here anyway? jessie told me you didn't want to come up here. i don't want to be anywhere that's not home. jessie's trying so hard to help you, kiddo. if you're as smart as they say you are, you know she's about the best friend you got. the storm's over poho county. we'll be lucky to get a drop. when a thunderstorm comes up, i can feel it inside. and when lightning comes down, i can feel it wanting to come to me. grandma said it was god. she said the white fire was god. do you believe in god, sheriff? that it was god who took my mother? anna! hey. took your mother? your grandfolks told you that? i remember it. hello, john, mitch. what the hell are you doing out this far? what are you? you're supposed to be at the lake, skinny dipping with the rest of the faggots. you afraid you're gonna get a little color on that marshmallow ass of yours?

harley? break it up, guys. come on. okay. doug i left camp for less than an hour. when i get back, one of my deputies is being hauled down the mountain in an ambulance. the boys tell me that you gave him some sort of an attack. it was like a seizure. is that right? no. then what did happen? why won't you tell anyone? i let him see. i opened him up, and i let him see. he just couldn't see what he was doing, so i helped him. lucy sheriff. you better start leveling with me. go ahead. it's maxine, doug. she just called. i'm on my way. i gotta go. i need you to think real hard about telling me what happened. thanks, jess. jeremy, please. i want to go home. do you understand that? i want to go home. look, whatever happened up there, whatever you saw. i saw that i don't like what you do! any of you! jeremy. no! you pretend to be my friend, the way you pretend everything! a friend doesn't lock you up! a friend doesn't take you away from your home. .and say that it's for your own good! how long do you really think i'll let you keep me here? she's all right. i got nervous when i couldn't find you, so i called the doc. harley just got admitted over at county. give a call over there, will you, maxine? find out how he's doing. listen, this is like having your heart torn out every day. doug, there's no explanation why your wife should still be alive right now. doug give me the short one, will you, doc? duane she can't like seeing this strain on you, which may be why she's hanging on through the worst pain of her life. it's just gonna make it that much easier if we get her back to county. this is where she wants to be, duane. she told me when she still could. she keeps holding on. i just don't know why. duane and you won't. doug, she's past communicating. you can't get inside of her head. and if you could, she'd probably tell you, let me go. ripley knock, knock. mind if i come in? hey, you, you did something to me. um. you know, i didn't figure it out until enough people looked at me like i was crazy or told me to act my age, but you, uh, uh, zapped me or i, uh, zapped myself when i touched you. but i've been. i've been running around on this high like i was again. i've had more ideas and more, more focus and better sex than i've had in years. do you believe me? well. why shouldn't you? you know if what i say is bullshit, don't you? so you know when i say i'm just here to talk that, uh, that i mean it. uh, say, did you. did you read any, uh, einstein? no? oh, well. oh, i think you'd like him. um, he said he believed in life after death. only because energy can never cease to exist. that it relays, it transforms, but it doesn't stop ever. uh, and he said that if we ever got to the point where we could use all our brain, uh, that we'd be pure energy and that we wouldn't even need bodies. now, um, what would you say to the possibility that because something happened to you, uh, something that never does or isn't supposed to, that you are, are closer to that energy level than any one body has ever been? i'd say, so what? so what? jeremy, you know, your life up till now has been that farmhouse and, uh, and the acres of earth. you know, you've kind of lived in books. but i think you're starting to find out now that the misery that you read about is real. the tragedy is, is real in all those stories, jeremy. did you think that it wasn't? i mean, my god, that deer hunt. you think that's the dark side of man? killing for pleasure? i'm sorry. i'm really sorry, but you haven't begun to see what we do. we're. jesus, we're stumbling around in a very dark age, basically just trying not to kill each other. so it hurts me when you say, so what? because you are not just different, jeremy. i think that you have a mind that, uh, that we won't evolve to for like, uh, thousands of years. you're maybe the man of the future right here and now. i don't know. and i'm not here to hurt you. jeremy, i want to be a friend. i want to talk with you. well. i mean, did you ever have a friend? i don't need a friend. really? gee, i thought you were a genius. you know what i say is true. are you telling me you, like, never shook anybody's hand before? ah, how do you do? hmm? now we've been properly introduced. want to see a trick? hmm. wow. they were afraid to touch me after a while. my grandma and grandpa, they. they got really scared. what? to touch you? jeremy, that's not right. no way. that's not right. doug. you've done a little spring cleaning? what the hell are you doing here, doug? a couple of my deputies told me that harley duncan got rid of every goddamn gun in his house. said he dropped out of the marksman tourney over in butte, too. the one he wins every year. i just ain't huntin' no more, doug. is that some kind of crime? i just got lots of other stuff to do. you gonna stop carrying one on the job? if you can't pick it up and use it, that's a liability. i want you to level with me. i already know you snuck off hunting with the boys, which is the last damn thing you should have done. yeah, i know. i know. and i popped this pretty doe, just up at little lake. let me tell you something, doug. you ever tell anybody i said this, i'm moving out of town. that. kid? he lays his hand on the deer while it's still shakin', and then he touches me at the same time. now, i can't figure out why, till my heart starts poundin' and i'm shakin', and i'm feelin' myself hurt and scared shitless, slippin' away in the goddamn dark. that's the worst thing i ever felt. it's like i could feel that animal dyin'. it's like i was the goddamn thing. aw, come on, harley. doug, i swear. now. i just can't do it anymore. i can't look at something down the barrel of a gun without thinking about it. i've tried it. i'm telling you, that thing ain't normal. i'm telling you, he took whatever was in that goddamn deer, and he put it right into me. doug i'm sorry, son. uh. jessie said it may be okay for you to come with me. i don't know what it is you do. i'm not even sure i believe you can do it. but if you can, i need your help. maxine doug barnum, don't you do this. that boy should not be in this house! go to bed, maxine. if you heard the stories i've heard, you wouldn't want him in this house! go on, go on. go back to bed. i'm telling you, that boy should not be here. go to bed, maxine. she knows you're here. doug talk to me, woman. tell me what i can do for you, emma. she can't go, not until she knows you're gonna get through this. she says the both of you. you and steven. steven? what the hell do you want me to do? what should i do? throw my arms around him? jeremy she wants you to remember the snow when steven was younger. and it was snowing. you were all playing in it. a snowball fight. and she lost her. ring. you lost your wedding ring. you looked down at your hand, and it was gone. we all looked. me and steven, we dug through the snow all afternoon. he came back from school every day, digging through the snow banks, thinking he'd find it. jeremy she cried that you both loved her so much. the way each of you looked so hard for it. i remember that. i do. jeremy the silver box. the silver box on the table. oh, no, mama. no. oh, no. jeremy he found it at the old house. in a garden he was tilling. he said he knew right away what it was, and that it was time to come home. she says she believes in miracles now. and that you should, too. she thinks i'm an angel come to take her home. and to bring you and steven together again. remind you how much you're still in each other's hearts. everything about each other we don't like. you know that. he loves you more than any man in the whole world. and she won't go, she won't leave this place, this room, or this world, until you know that you still have a son. she'd like to feel the ring on her finger. you can hear. oh, it's all right. angel, it's all right. good bye, emma, sweetie. hurry! what? he's got him up there right now! what? what is. he's got him up there with your mama! papa. lindsey why don't we just tell them all to stop, and they can just take a picture or something? jeremy, are you okay? they're wondering if i killed her. don't tell me you're seeing inside them again. what are people like on the inside? inside most people there's a feeling of being separate. separated from everything. and? and they're not. they're part of absolutely everyone and everything. everything? i'm part of this tree? part of zack barking over fences? you're telling me that i'm part of some fisherman in italy on some ocean i've never even heard of? of some guy sitting on death row. i'm part of him, too? you don't believe me. it's hard to believe that, all of that. well, that's because you have this spot that you can't see past. my grams and gramps had it. a spot where they were taught they were disconnected from everything. so that's what they'd see if they could? that they're connected? and how beautiful they really are. and that there's no need to hide or lie. and that it's possible to talk to someone without any lies. with no sarcasms, no deceptions, no exaggerations, or any of the things that people use to confuse the truth. i don't know a single person who does that. hold out your hand. put your fingers up. wow. is that your heartbeat? and yours. wow, this feels strange. you're afraid someone will see us holding hands. you're really nervous talking to me. you don't think you're pretty enough. you feel alone. you feel so alone. sometimes you just want to break out of yourself. your father. your father hurt you a long time ago. you're so sad. he made you so sad. he thought you were, you were ugly and. and he kept saying you, you weren't. i'm so sorry. do you? do you? do i what? do you think i'm ugly? i don't know what i think when i look at you. but sometimes i think, i think you're the most beautiful face i've ever seen. what? what in the name of god do you think you're doing? you having a good time with my daughter? wonderful. it's a good school. you think this is funny? funny man, huh? dad! you think this is funny, huh, lover boy? would you stop? now, i asked you a question, and i want an answer. would you please. you think it's funny?
