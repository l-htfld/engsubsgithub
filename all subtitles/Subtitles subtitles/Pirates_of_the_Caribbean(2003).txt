 cursed pirates sail these waters. you don't wanna bring them down on us, do you? mr. gibbs, that will do. she was singing about pirates. bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog, mark my words. consider them marked. on your way. aye, lieutenant. it's bad luck to have a woman on board too. even a miniature one. i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate. think again, miss swann. vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. i intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves a short drop and a sudden stop. lieutenant norrington, i appreciate your fervour, but i'm concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter. my apologies, governor swann. actually, i find it all fascinating. yes, that's what concerns me. look, a boy. there's a boy in the water. man overboard! man the ropes. fetch a hook. haul him aboard. he's still breathing. mary, mother of god. what happened here? it was most likely the powder magazine. merchant vessels run heavily armed. a lot of good it did them. everyone's thinking it. i'm just saying it. pirates. there's no proof of that. it was probably an accident. rouse the captain immediately. aye, sir. heave to and take in sail. launch the boats. heave to. elizabeth, i want you to accompany the boy. he'll be in your charge. take care of him. it's okay. my name's elizabeth swann. will turner. i'm watching over you, will. you're a pirate. has he said anything? his name's william turner. that's all i found out. take him below. elizabeth? are you all right? are you decent? yes. yes. you still abed at this hour? it's a beautiful day. i have a gift for you. oh, it's beautiful. isn't it? may i enquire as to the occasion? does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter? go on. actually, i i had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today. the ceremony? captain norrington's promotion ceremony. i knew it. commodore norrington, as he's about to become. a fine gentleman, don't you think? he fancies you, you know. elizabeth? how's it coming'? it's difficult to say. i'm told it's the latest fashion in london. well, women in london must have learned not to breathe. my lord, you have a visitor. mr. turner, good to see you again. good day, sir. i have your order. the blade is folded steel. that's gold filigree laid into the handle. if i may? perfectly balanced. the tang is nearly the full width of the blade. impressive. very impressive. well, now. commodore norrington's going to be very pleased with this. do pass my compliments on to your master. i shall. a craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated. elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning. will. it's so good to see you. i had a dream about you last night. about me? elizabeth, is that entirely proper for you to ? about the day we met. do you remember? how could i forget, miss swann? will, how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth? at least once more, miss swann, as always. there, you see? at least the boy has a sense of propriety. now, we really must be going. there you are. good day, mr. turner. come along. good day. elizabeth. what ? hold up there, you. it's a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock. and i shall need to know your name. what do you say to shillings and we forget the name? welcome to port royal, mr. smith. two paces, march! right about face! present arms! this dock is off limits to civilians. i'm terribly sorry, i didn't know. if i see one, i shall inform you immediately. apparently, there's some sort of high toned and fancy to do up at the fort. how could it be two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did not merit an invitation? someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians. it's a fine goal, to be sure, but it seems to me a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous, really. oh, the dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough. but there's no ship that can match the interceptor for speed. i've heard of one. supposed to be very fast, nigh uncatchable. the black pearl. well, there's no real ship that could match the interceptor. black pearl is a real ship. no. no, it's not. yes, it is. i've seen it. you've seen it? yes. you haven't seen it. yes, i have. you've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out? no. no. but i have seen a ship with black sails. oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him out could possibly have black sails. therefore it couldn't possibly be any other ship than the black pearl. is that what you're saying? no. like i said, there's no real ship that could match the interceptor. hey! you! get away from there. you don't have permission to be aboard there, mate. i'm sorry. it's just it's such a pretty boat. ship. what's your name? smith. or smitty, if you like. what's your purpose in port royal, mr. smith? and no lies. why, then i confess. it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out. i said no lies. i think he's telling the truth. if he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us. unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth, even if he told it to you. may i have a moment? you look lovely, elizabeth. i apologise if i seem forward, but i must speak my mind. this promotion throws into sharp relief that which i have not yet achieved. a marriage to a fine woman. you have become a fine woman, elizabeth. i can't breathe. yes, i'm a bit nervous myself. and then they made me their chief. elizabeth? elizabeth! the rocks. sir, it's a miracle she missed them. will you be saving her then? i can't swim. pride of the king's navy, you are. do not lose these. what was that? make way. i got her. she's not breathing. move. i never would have thought of that. clearly, you've never been to singapore. where did you get that? on your feet. elizabeth. are you all right? yes. yes, i'm fine. shoot him. father. what? commodore, do you really intend to kill my rescuer? i believe thanks are in order. had a brush with the east india trading company, did we, pirate? hang him. keep your guns on him, men. gillette, fetch some irons. well, well, jack sparrow, isn't it? captain jack sparrow, if you please. well, i don't see your ship, captain. i'm in the market, as it were. he said he came to commandeer one. i told you he was telling the truth. these are his, sir. no additional shots nor powder. a compass that doesn't point north. and i half expected it to be made of wood. you are, without doubt, the worst pirate i've ever heard of. but you have heard of me. commodore, i really must protest. carefully, lieutenant. pirate or not, this man saved my life. one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness. though it seems enough to condemn him. indeed. finally. no. no, don't shoot. i knew you'd warm up to me. commodore norrington, my effects, please. and my hat. commodore. elizabeth. it is elizabeth, isn't it'? it's miss swann. miss swann, if you'd be so kind? come, come, dear. we don't have all day. now, if you'll be very kind. easy on the goods, darling. you're despicable. sticks and stones, love. i saved your life, you save mine, we're square. gentlemen, my lady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught captain jack sparrow. now will you shoot him? open fire! on his heels. take steady aim. fire! fire! fire. take care of him. fire! gillette, mr. sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows. i would hate for him to miss it. search upstairs. look lively, men. right where i left you. not where i left you. you're the one they're hunting. the pirate. you seem somewhat familiar. have i threatened you before? i make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates. well, it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. so if you'll excuse me? do you think this wise, boy? crossing blades with a pirate? you threatened miss swann. only a little. you know what you're doing, i'll give you that. excellent form. but how's your footwork? if i step here very good. and now i step again. ta. that is a wonderful trick. except once again, you are between me and my way out. and now you have no weapon. who makes all these? i do. and i practise with them three hours a day. you need to find yourself a girl, mate. or perhaps the reason you practise three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. you're not a eunuch, are you? i practise three hours a day so that when i meet a pirate, i can kill him. you cheated. pirate. move away. no. please move? no. i cannot just step aside and let you escape. this shot is not meant for you. come on. there he is. over here. excellent work, mr. brown. you've assisted in the capture of a dangerous fugitive. just doing my civic duty, sir. well, i trust that you will always remember this as the day that captain jack sparrow almost escaped. take him away. hey, come on. can you smell it, boy? smell the bone. come here, boy. come on. you want a nice, juicy bone? come here, boy. come on. come here, boy. you can keep doing that forever, the dog is never going to move. oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet. there you go, miss. it was a difficult day for you, i'm sure. i suspected commodore norrington would propose but i must admit, i wasn't entirely prepared for it. well, i meant your being threatened by that pirate. it sounds terrifying. yes, it was terrifying. but the commodore proposed. fancy that. now, that's a smart match, miss, if it's not too bold to say. it is a smart match. he's a fine man. the sort any woman should dream of marrying. well, that will turner, he's a fine man too. that is too bold. oh, begging your pardon, miss. it was not my place. has my daughter given you an answer yet? no, she hasn't. well, she has had a very trying day. ghastly weather, don't you think? bleak. very bleak. what's that? cannon fire! return fire. i know those guns. men to arms. it's the pearl. the black pearl? i've heard stories. she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years. never leaves any survivors. no survivors? then where do the stories come from, i wonder? clear the dock! mama! mind your oars. come on, you. i need that to see. come back. sight the muzzle flash. aim for the flashes. i need a full spread, fore and aft. mr. stevens, more cartridges. governor. barricade yourself in my office. good god. that's an order. don't! hello, chum. up there. miss swann, they've come to kidnap you. what? you're the governor's daughter. come on, in here. listen, they haven't seen you. go hide and the first chance you can, run to the fort. no! gotcha. had enough? no, no. it's hot. i'm burning. come on. come on, you mates. we know you're here, poppet. poppet. come out. and we promise we won't hurt you. we will find you, poppet. you've got something of ours and it calls to us. the gold calls to us. the gold, the gold. hello, poppet. parley! what? parley. i invoke the right of parley. according to the code of the brethren, set down by morgan and bartholomew, you have to take me to your captain. i know the code. if an adversary demands parley, you can do then no harm until the parley is complete. to blazes with the code. she wants to be taken to the captain. and she'll go without a fuss. we must honour the code. say goodbye. goodbye. come on. elizabeth. hello. out of my way, scum. my sympathies, friend. you've no matter of luck at all. come on, doggie. it's just you and me now. it's you and old jack. come on. come on, that's it, boy. good boy. come and get the bone. that's a good boy. come on. a bit closer. a bit closer. that's it. that's it, doggie. come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy cur. oh, no. don't do that. no, no, no, i didn't mean it. i didn't gotcha. this ain't the armoury. well, well, well. look what we have here, twigg. captain jack sparrow. last time i saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island shrinking into the distance. his fortunes aren't improved much. worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen. the deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers. so there is a curse. that's interesting. you know nothing of hell. that's very interesting. no! i didn't know we was taking on captives. she's invoked the right of parley with captain barbossa. i'm here to negotiate you will speak when spoken to. and ye'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley. aye, sir. my apologies, miss. captain barbossa, i am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal. there were a lot of long words in there, miss. we're nought but humble pirates. what is it that you want? i want you to leave and never come back. i'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request. means no. very well. i'll drop it. me holds are bursting with swag. that bit of shine matters to us? why? it's what you've been searching for. i recognise this ship. i saw it eight years ago on the crossing from england. did you, now? fine. well, i suppose if it is worthless, then there's no point in me keeping it. no. you have a name, missy? elizabeth turner. i'm a maid in the governor's household. miss turner. turner? bootstrap. and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? family heirloom perhaps? i didn't steal it if that's what you mean. very well. you hand it over and we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return. our bargain? still the guns and stow them. signal the men. set the flags. make good to clear port. wait. you have to take me to shore. according to the code of the order first, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, so i must do nothing. and secondly, you must be a pirate for the pirates' code to apply, and you're not. and thirdly, the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules. welcome aboard the black pearl, miss turner. they've taken her. they've taken elizabeth. mr. murtogg, remove this man. we have to hunt them down. we must save her. and where do you propose we start? if you have any information concerning my daughter, please share it. that jack sparrow, he talked about the black pearl. mentioned it is more what he did. ask him where it is. make a deal with him. he could lead us to it. no. the pirates who invaded this fort left sparrow locked in his cell. ergo, they are not his allies. governor, we will establish their most likely course and launch that's not good enough! mr. turner, you are not a military man. you are not a sailor. you are a blacksmith. and this is not the moment for rash actions. do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who cares for elizabeth. please, please. you, sparrow. aye? you're familiar with that ship, the black pearl? i've heard of it. where does it make berth? where does it make berth? have you not heard the stories? captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the dreaded isla de muerta. it's an island that cannot be found, except by those who already know where it is. the ship's real enough. therefore its anchorage must be a real place. where is it? why ask me? because you're a pirate. and you want to turn pirate yourself, is that it? never. they took miss swann. oh, so it is that you found a girl. i see. well, if you're intending to brave all, hasten to her rescue, and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone, mate. i see no profit in it for me. i can get you out of here. how's that? the key's run off. i helped build these cells. these are half pin barrel hinges. with the right leverage and the proper application of strength, the door will lift free. what's your name? will turner. that would be short for william, i imagine. good strong name. no doubt named for your father, eh? yes. well, mr. turner, i've changed me mind. if you spring me from this cell, i swear on pain of death, i shall take you to the black pearl and your bonnie lass. do we have an accord? agreed. agreed. get me out. hurry. someone will have heard that. not without my effects. we're gonna steal the ship. that ship? commandeer. we're gonna commandeer that ship. nautical term. one question about your business, boy, or there's no use going. this girl, how far are you willing to go to save her? i'd die for her. oh, good. no worries, then. this is either madness or brilliance. it's remarkable how often those two traits coincide. everyone, stay calm. we are taking over the ship. aye. avast. this ship cannot be crewed by two men. you'll never make it out of the bay. son, i'm captain jack sparrow. savvy? commodore. sir, they've taken the dauntless. commodore! they've taken the ship! sparrow and turner, they've taken the dauntless. rash, turner. too rash. that is, without doubt, the worst pirate i have ever seen. here they come. bring her around! bring her around! hold on! grab on! search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges. this way, men. check the aft. and the portside. sailors, back to the interceptor, now. quickly, men. thank you, commodore, for getting us ready to make way. we'd have had a hard time of it by ourselves. set topsails and clear up this mess. with the wind a quarter astern, we won't catch them. i don't need to catch them. get them in range of the long nines. helm, come about! run out the guns! we are to fire on our own ship, sir? i'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate. commodore. he's disabled the rudder chain, sir. abandon ship! let go the gear and sheet home. sheet home, aye, sir. that's got to be the best pirate i've ever seen. so it would seem. when i was a lad living in england, my mother raised me by herself. after she died, i came out here looking for my father. is that so? my father? bill turner? in the jail, it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. since that's what i wanted, i didn't press the matter. i'm not a simpleton, jack. you knew my father. i knew him. probably one of the few who knew him as william turner. everyone else just called him bootstrap or bootstrap bill. bootstrap? good man. good pirate. i swear, you look just like him. it's not true. he was a merchant sailor. a good, respectable man who obeyed the law. he was a bloody pirate. a scallywag. my father was not a pirate. put it away, son. it's not worth you getting beat again. you didn't beat me. you ignored the rules of engagement. in a fair fight, i'd kill you. then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it'? now, as long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. the only rules that really matter are these what a man can do and what a man can't do. for instance, you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man, or you can't. but pirate is in your blood, boy, so you'll have to square with that someday. now, me, for example, i can let you drown but i can't bring this ship into tortuga all by me onesies. savvy? so. can you sail under the command of a pirate? or can you not? tortuga? tortuga. more importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep the sweet, proliferous bouquet that is tortuga. savvy? what do you think? it'll linger. i'll tell you, mate if every town in the world were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted. scarlett. not sure i deserved that. giselle. who was she? what? i may have deserved that. curse you for breathing, you slack jawed idiot. mother's love. jack. you should know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. it's bad luck. fortunately, i know how to counter it. the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink. the man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking. aye. that'll about do it. blast, i'm already awake! that was for the smell. keep a sharp eye. now, what's the nature of this venture of yours? i'm going after the black pearl. i know where it's going to be and i'm gonna take it. jack, it's a fool's errand. well, you know better than me the tales of the black pearl. that's why i know what barbossa is up to. all i need is a crew. from what i hear tell of captain barbossa, he's not a man to suffer fools, nor strike a bargain with one. then i'd say it's a good thing i'm not a fool. prove me wrong. what makes you think barbossa will give up his ship to you? let's just say it's a matter of leverage, eh? the kid? that is the child of bootstrap bill turner. his only child. savvy? is he, now? leverage, says you. i think i feel a change in the wind, says i. i'll find us a crew. there's bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you. one can only hope. take what you can. give nothing back. you'll be dining with the captain. and he requests you wear this. well, you may tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request. he said you'd say that. he also said, if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew. and you'll be naked. fine. there is no need to stand on ceremony, no call to impress anyone. you must be hungry. try the wine. and the apples. one of those next. it's poisoned. there would be no sense to be killing you, miss turner. then release me. you have your trinket, i'm of no further value to you. you don't know what this is, do you? it's a pirate medallion. this is aztec gold. one of identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to cort s himself. blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies. but the greed of cort s was insatiable. and so the heathen gods placed upon the gold a terrible curse. any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest shall be punished for eternity. i hardly believe in ghost stories any more, captain barbossa. aye. that's exactly what i thought when we were first told the tale. buried on an island of the dead what cannot be found except for those who know where it is. find it, we did. there be the chest. inside be the gold. and we took them all. we spent them and traded them and frittered them away on drink and food and pleasurable company. the more we gave them away, the more we came to realise the drink would not satisfy, food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust. we are cursed men, miss turner. compelled by greed we were, but now we are consumed by it. there is one way we can end our curse. all the scattered pieces of the aztec gold must be restored and the blood repaid. thanks to you we have the final piece. and the blood to be repaid? that's why there's no sense to be killing you yet. apple? no! i'm curious. after killing me, what is it you're planning on doing next? oh, no. look. the moonlight shows us for what we really are. we are not among the living, and so we cannot die. but neither are we dead. for too long i've been parched of thirst and unable to quench it. too long i've been starving to death and haven't died. i feel nothing. not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea. nor the warmth of a woman's flesh. you'd best start believing in ghost stories, miss turner. you're in one. what are you looking at? back to work. you heard the captain. back to work. feast your eyes, captain. all of them faithful hands before the mast. every man worth his salt. and crazy, to boot. so this is your able bodied crew? you, sailor. cotton, sir. mr. cotton, do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death? mr. cotton. answer, man. he's a mute, sir. poor devil had his tongue cutout. so he trained the parrot to talk for him. no one's yet figured how. mr. cotton's parrot. same question. wind in your sails. wind in your sails. mostly we figure that means, yes. of course it does. satisfied? well, you've proved they're mad. and what's the benefit for us? anamaria. i suppose you didn't deserve that one either. no, that one i deserved. you stole my boat. actually borrowed. borrowed without permission. but with every intention of bringing it back to you. but you didn't. you'll get another one. i will. a better one. a better one. that one. what one? that one? aye. that one. what say you? aye! aye! anchor's aweigh. no, no, no. it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir. it'll be far worse not to have her. how can we sail to an island that nobody can find with a compass that doesn't work? aye, the compass doesn't point north. but we're not trying to find north, are we? we should drop canvas, sir. she can hold a bit longer. what in your head has put you in such a fine mood, captain? we're catching up. time to go, poppet dead men tell no tales. puts a chill in the bones, how many honest sailors have been claimed by this passage. how is it that jack came by that compass? not a lot's known about jack sparrow before he showed up in tortuga with a mind to go after the treasure of the isla de muerta. that was before i'd met him, back when he was captain of the black pearl. what? he failed to mention that. well, he plays things close to the vest now. and a hard learned lesson it was. three days out on the venture, the first mate comes to him and says everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the treasure too. so jack gives up the bearings. that night there was a mutiny. they marooned jack on an island and left him to die. but not before he'd gone mad with the heat. so that's the reason for all the reason's got nothing to do with it. now, will, when a pirate's marooned, he's given a pistol with a single shot. one shot. well, that won't do much good hunting or to be rescued. but after three weeks of a starving belly and thirst, that pistol starts to look real friendly. but jack, he escaped the island, and he still has that single shot. oh, he won't use it, though, save on one man. his mutinous first mate. barbossa. aye. how did jack get off the island? well, i'll tell you. he waded out into the shallows and he waited there three days and three nights till all manner of sea creatures became acclimated to his presence. then on the fourth morning he roped himself a couple of sea turtles, lashed them together and made a raft. he roped a couple of sea turtles. aye, sea turtles. what did he use for rope? human hair. from my back. let go the anchor. lower the anchor line! young mr. turner and i are to go ashore. captain, what if the worst should happen? keep to the code. aye, the code. move. ten years of hoarding swag and now we finally get to spend it. once we're quit of the curse, we'll be rich men. and you can buy an eye what actually fits and is made of glass. this one does splinter something terrible. stop rubbing it. what code is gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen? pirates' code. any man who falls behind is left behind. no heroes amongst thieves, eh? you know, for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you're well on your way to becoming one. sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of tortuga. and you're completely obsessed with treasure. that's not true. i am not obsessed with treasure. not all treasure is silver and gold, mate. gentlemen, the time has come. our salvation is nigh. our torment is near an end. elizabeth. for ten years we've been tested and tried, and each man jack of you here has proved his mettle a hundred times over. and a hundred times again. suffered i have. punished we were, the lot of us. disproportionate to our crime. here it is. the cursed treasure of cort s himself. every last piece that went astray we have returned. save for this. jack. not yet. we wait for the opportune moment. saving what we found, despairing of ever finding the last. when's that? when it's of greatest profit to you? may i ask you something? have i ever given you reason not to trust me? do us a favour. i know it's difficult for you, but please stay here. and try not to do anything stupid. and who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods? and whose blood must yet be paid? hers! you know the first thing i'm gonna do after the curse is lifted? eat a whole bushel of apples. begun by blood. by blood undone. sorry, jack. i'm not gonna be your leverage. that's it? waste not. did it work? i don't feel no different. how do we tell? you're not dead. no. you shot me. it didn't work. the curse is still upon us. you. maid. your father. what was his name? was your father william turner? no. where's his child? the child that sailed from england eight years ago. the child in whose veins flows the blood of william turner? where? you two. you brought us the wrong person. no. she had the medallion. she's the proper age. she said her name was turner. you heard her. i think she lied to us. you brought us here for nothing? i won't take questioning or second guesses, not from the likes of you, master twigg. who's to blame him? every decision you've made has led us from bad to worse. it was you who sent bootstrap to the depths. and it's you who brought us here in the first place. if any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak. i say we cut her throat and spill all her blood, just in case. yeah. the medallion! she's taken it! get after her, you feckless pack of ingrates. there's no oars here. where's the oars? they stole the oars. the oars have gone missing. find them. find the oars. you. you're supposed to be dead. am i not? pearlie. pa la la leh loo loo. parlinny. parsnip. parsley. par par no, partner. parley? that's the one. parley. parley. parley? damn to the depths whatever muttonhead thought up parley. that would be the french. not more pirates. welcome aboard, miss elizabeth. mr. gibbs? hey, boy, where be jack? jack? jack sparrow? fell behind. keep to the code. weigh anchor. hoist the sails. split quick, you dibbies. how the blazes did you get off that island? when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing, mate. i'm captain jack sparrow. well, i won't be making that mistake again. gents, you all remember captain jack sparrow. yeah. aye. kill him. the girl's blood didn't work, did it? hold your fire. you know whose blood we need. i know whose blood you need. what sort of a man trades a man's life for a ship? pirate. here. let me. thank you. you said you gave barbossa my name as yours. why? i don't know. i'm sorry. blacksmith's hands. i know they're rough. no. i mean, yes, they are but but don't stop. elizabeth. it's yours. i thought i'd lost it the day they rescued me. it was a gift from my father. he sent it to me. why did you take it? because i was afraid that you were a pirate. that would have been awful. it wasn't your blood they needed. it was my father's blood. my blood. the blood of a pirate. will, i'm so sorry. please forgive me. so you expect to leave me standing on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it's the one i need, and watch you sail away in my ship? no. i expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship, and then i'll shout the name back to you. savvy? but that leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with nought but a name and your word it's the one i need. of the two of us, i am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny. therefore, my word is the one we'll be trusting. although, i suppose i should be thanking you, because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me and left me to die i would have an equal share in that curse, same as you. funny old world, isn't it? captain, we're coming up on the interceptor. i'm having a thought here, barbossa. what say we run up a flag of truce, i scurry over to the interceptor, and i negotiate the return of your medallion? what say you to that? now, you see, jack, that's exactly the attitude that lost you the pearl. people are easier to search when they're dead. lock him in the brig. hands aloft to loose the gallants! with this wind dead astern, she'll carry every sail we've got. what's happening? the black pearl. she's gaining on us. but this is the fastest ship in the caribbean. you can tell them that after they've caught us. we're shallower on the draught, right? aye. well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals? we don't have to outrun them long. just long enough. lighten the ship. stem to stern. anything we can afford to lose, see that it's lost. apparently, there's a leak. haul on the main brace! make ready the guns! run out the sweeps. heave, ho! we're gonna need that. it was a good plan up till now. gibbs, we have to make a stand. we must fight. load the guns. with what? anything. everything. anything we have left. load the guns! case shot and langrage. nails and crushed glass. with a will! the pearl's gonna luff up on our port quarter. she'll rake us without ever presenting a target. lower the anchor on the right side. on the starboard side. it certainly has the element of surprise. you're daft, lady. you both are. daft like jack. lower the starboard anchor! do it, you gobs, or it's you we'll load into the cannons. starboard anchor, lower away. let go! they're club hauling. hard a port. rack the starboard oars. hard a port. starboard oars. keep her steady, man. now! fire! fire all! stop blowing holes in my ship. fire! fire! we could use a few more ideas, lass. your turn. we need us a devil's dowry. we'll give them her. she's not what they're after. the medallion. strike your colours, you blooming cockroaches. hands, grapnels at the ready. prepare to board. pistols and cutlasses, men. koehler, twigg. to the powder magazine! and the rest of you, bring me the medallion! hey! hey! hey! below! thanks very much. jack! bloody empty that's not very nice. where's the medallion? wretch! where is dear william? will. will. elizabeth. monkey. i can't move it. come on, you. no! will! elizabeth! will! why, thank you, jack. you're welcome. not you. we named the monkey jack. gents, our hope is restored. if any of you so much as thinks the word parley, i'll have your guts for garters. will. you godless savage! welcome back, miss. you took advantage of our hospitality last time. it holds fair now you return the favour. barbossa. will. she goes free. what's in your head, boy? she goes free. you've only got one shot, and we can't die. don't do anything stupid. you can't. i can. like that. who are you? no one. he's no one. a distant cousin of my aunt's nephew twice removed. lovely singing voice, though. eunuch. my name is will turner. my father was bootstrap bill turner. his blood runs in my veins. he's the spitting image of old bootstrap bill, come back to haunt us. on my word, do as i say or i'll pull this trigger and be lost to davy jones' locker. name your terms, mr. turner. elizabeth goes free. yes, we know that one. anything else? and the crew. the crew are not to be harmed. agreed. go on, poppet. walk the plank. go. go on, then. barbossa, you lying bastard. you swore she'd go free. don't dare impugn me honour, boy. i agreed she'd go free, but it was you who failed to specify when or where. though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don't it, lads? so i'll be having that dress back before you go. i always liked you. it goes with your black heart. it's still warm. off you go. come on. too long. i'd really rather hoped we were past all this. jack. jack. did you not notice? that be the same little island that we made you governor of on our last little trip. i did notice. perhaps you'll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape. but i doubt it. off you go. last time you left me a pistol with one shot. by the powers, you're right. where be jack's pistol? bring it forward. seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols. it'll be one pistol as before, and you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady and starve to death yourself. that's the second time i've had to watch that man sail away with my ship. but you were marooned on this island before, weren't you? we can escape the same way you did. to what point and purpose, young missy? the black pearl is gone. and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice unlikely. young mr. turner will be dead long before you can reach him. but you're captain jack sparrow. you vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the east india company. you sacked nassau port without even firing a shot. are you the pirate i've read about or not? how did you escape last time? last time i was here a grand total of three days, all right? last time the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and i was able to barter passage off. from the looks of things, they've long been out of business. probably have your bloody friend norrington to thank for that. so that's it, then? that's the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow? you spent three days lying on a beach drinking rum. welcome to the caribbean, love. we're devils, we're black sheep we're really bad eggs drink up, me hearties, yo ho yo ho, yo ho a pirate's life for me i love this song. really bad egg. when i get the pearl back i'm gonna teach it to the whole crew and we'll sing it all the time. and you will be positively the most fearsome pirates in the spanish main. not just the spanish main, love the entire ocean. the entire world. wherever we want to go, we go. that's what a ship is, you know. it's not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. that's what a ship needs. but what a ship is what the black pearl really is is freedom. jack. it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island. oh, yes. but the company is infinitely better than last time, and the scenery has definitely improved. mr. sparrow, i'm not entirely sure that i've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. i know exactly what you mean, love. to freedom. to the black pearl. no. not good. stop. not good. what are you doing? you burned all the food, the shade, the rum. yes, the rum is gone. why is the rum gone? one, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels. two, that signal is over a thousand feet high. the entire royal navy is out looking for me. do you really think that there is even the slightest chance that they won't see it? but why is the rum gone? just wait, captain sparrow. you give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye open, and you will see white sails on that horizon. it must have been terrible for you to be trapped here, jack. must have been terrible for you well, it bloody is now! there'll be no living with her after this. but we've got to save will. no. you're safe now. we will return to port royal immediately, not go gallivanting after pirates. then we condemn him to death. the boy's fate is regrettable. but then, so was his decision to engage in piracy. to rescue me. to prevent anything from happening to me. if i may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion, the pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle. it's very unlikely she'll be able to make good time. think about it. the black pearl. the last real pirate threat in the caribbean, mate. how can you pass that up, eh? by remembering that i serve others mr. sparrow, not only myself. commodore, i beg you, please do this. for me. as a wedding gift. elizabeth. are you accepting the commodore's proposal? i am. a wedding. i love weddings. drinks all around. i know. clap him in irons, right? mr. sparrow, you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing to isla de muerta. you'll then spend the rest of the voyage contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase silent as the grave. do i make myself clear? inescapably clear. shiver me timbers. cotton here says you missed a bit. you knew william turner? old bootstrap bill. we knew him. never sat well with bootstrap what we did to jack sparrow. the mutiny and all. he said it wasn't right with the code. that's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you, as it were. he said we deserved to be cursed and remain cursed. stupid blighter. good man. but, as you can imagine, that didn't sit too well with the captain. that didn't sit too well with the captain at all. tell him what barbossa did. i'm telling the story. so, what the captain did, he strapped a cannon to bootstrap's bootstraps. bootstrap's bootstraps. the last we saw of old bill turner he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of davy jones' locker. of course, it was only after that, we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse. that's what you call ironic. bring him. i don't care for the situation. any attempt to storm the caves could turn to an ambush. not if you're the one doing the ambushing. i go in and convince barbossa to send his men out with their little boats. you and your mates return to the dauntless and blast the bejesus out of them with your little cannons, aye. what do you have to lose? nothing i'd lament being rid of. now, to be quite honest with you, there's still a risk to those aboard the dauntless, which includes the future mrs. commodore. sorry, but it's for your own safety. i don't care what the commodore ordered. i have to tell him. the pirates. they're cursed, they can't be killed. don't worry, miss, he's already informed of that. a little mermaid flopped up on deck and told him the whole story. this is jack sparrow's doing. no reason to fret. just a prick of the finger. a few drops of blood. no mistakes this time. he's only half turner. we spill it all. guess there is reason to fret. beg your pardon, beg your pardon. begun by blood. excuse me. by blood and jack. it's not possible. not probable. where's elizabeth? she's safe, just like i promised. she's all set to marry norrington, just like she promised. and you get to die for her, just like you promised. so we're all men of our word, really. except for elizabeth, who is, in fact, a woman. shut up. you're next. you don't want to be doing that, mate. no, i really think i do. your funeral. why don't i want to be doing it? well, because because the hms dauntless, pride of the royal navy, is floating just offshore, waiting for you. what we doing here? the pirates come out, unprepared and unawares. we catch them in a crossfire, send them down to see old hob. i know why we're here. i meant, why aren't we doing what it was what mr. sparrow said we should do? with the cannons and all? because it was mr. sparrow who said it. you think he wasn't telling the truth? just hear me out, mate. order your men to the dauntless. they do what they do best. robert's your uncle, fannie's your aunt. there you are with two ships. the makings of your very own fleet. of course, you'll take the grandest as your flagship, and who's to argue? but what of the pearl? name me captain. i'll sail under your colours, i'll give you percent of me plunder, and you get to introduce yourself as commodore barbossa. savvy? i suppose in exchange, you want me not to kill the whelp. no, no, no. not at all. by all means, kill the whelp. just not yet. wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. for instance, after you've killed norrington's men. every last one. you've been planning this from the beginning. ever since you learned my name. yeah. i want percent of your plunder. fifteen. forty. twenty five. i'll buy you the hat. a really big one, commodore. we have an accord. all hands to the boats. apologies. you give the orders. gents, take a walk. not to the boats? hold fire. oh, this is just like what the greeks done at troy. except they was in a horse instead of dresses. wooden horse. a moment, please. elizabeth. i just want you to know, i i believe you made a very good decision today. couldn't be more proud of you. but you know, even a good decision, if made for the wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision. look into that, will you? report back. lieutenant? elizabeth. are you there? elizabeth, are you even listening to me? oh, what have you done? stop that. already feel like a fool. look nice, though. i look nice? i must admit, jack, i thought i had you figured. but it turns out you're a hard man to predict. me? i'm dishonest. and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. honestly. it's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're gonna do something incredibly stupid. you're off the edge of the map, mate. here there be monsters. right. what would you pick to eat first? i think we should decide now. just so we're ready when the time comes. what was that? miss elizabeth. make for the ship. move. to the ship! row, men. you can't beat me, jack. that's interesting. i couldn't resist, mate. sorry. so, what now, jack sparrow? are we to be two immortals locked in an epic battle until judgment day and the trumpets sound? or you could surrender. all of you with me. will is in that cave and we must save him. ready. and heave. please, i need your help. come on. any port in a storm. cotton's right. we've got the pearl. what about jack? are you just gonna leave him? jack owes us a ship. and there's the code to consider. the code? you're pirates. hang the code and hang the rules. they're more like guidelines anyway. bloody pirates. what? is it supposed to be doing that? they're stealing our ship. bloody pirates. boarders away. come on! me eye. i'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain. do you like pain? try wearing a corset. whose side is jack on? at the moment? no fair. ten years you carry that pistol, and now you waste your shot. he didn't waste it. i feel. cold. parley? the ship is ours, gentlemen. we should return to the dauntless. your fianc will be wanting to know you're safe. if you were waiting for the opportune moment. that was it. now, if you'd be so kind, i'd be much obliged if you'd drop me off at my ship. i'm sorry, jack. they done what's right by them. can't expect more than that. jack sparrow, be it known that you have been charged. captain. captain jack sparrow. for your wilful commission of crimes against the crown. said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature. the most egregious of these to be cited herewith. piracy, smuggling. this is wrong. commodore norrington is bound by the law. as are we all. impersonating an officer of the spanish royal navy. impersonating a cleric of the church of england. oh, yeah. .sailing under false colours, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation, and general lawlessness. and for these crimes, you have been sentenced to be, on this day, hung by the neck until dead. may god have mercy on your soul. governor swann. commodore. elizabeth. i should have told you every day from the moment i met you. i love you. watch yourself. marines. i can't breathe. elizabeth. move. you men, quickly! what? move. come on. come on! right, right. come on, lads. i thought we might have to endure some manner of ill conceived escape attempt. but not from you. on our return to port royal, i granted you clemency. and this is how you thank me? by throwing in your lot with him? he's a pirate. and a good man. if all i've achieved here is the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it. at least my conscience will be clear. you forget your place, turner. it's right here, between you and jack. as is mine. elizabeth. lower your weapons. for goodness' sake, put them down. so this is where your heart truly lies, then? it is. well, i'm actually feeling rather good about this. i think we've all arrived at a special place, eh? spiritually, ecumenically, grammatically. i want you to know that i was rooting for you, mate. know that. elizabeth. it would never have worked between us, darling. i'm sorry. will. nice hat. friends. this is a day that you will always remember as the day that idiot. he's nowhere to go but back to the noose. sail ho! what's your plan of action? sir? perhaps on the rare occasion pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy, piracy itself can be the right course? mr. turner. i will accept the consequences of my actions. this is a beautiful sword. i would expect the man who made it to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life. thank you. commodore. what about sparrow? well, i think we can afford to give him one day's head start. so. this is the path you've chosen, is it? after all, he is a blacksmith. no. he's a pirate. heave. thought you were supposed to keep to the code. we figured they were more actual guidelines. thank you. captain sparrow. the black pearl is yours. on deck, you scabrous dogs. hands to braces. let down and haul to run free. now, bring me that horizon. and really bad eggs. drink up, me hearties
