''venice, ltaly.'' dr. jones! dr. jones? l trust your trip down was comfortable, dr. jones. uh, my men didn't alarm you, l hope. my name is donovan. walter donovan. l know who you are, mr. donovan. your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive. well, like yourself, dr. jones, l have a passion for antiquities. have a look over here. this might interest you. well, it's sandstone. christian symbol. early latin text. mid th century, l should think. that was our assessment, as well. where did this come from? my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper. can you translate the inscription? ''.who drinks the water l shall give him, says the lord, ''will have a. spring ''inside him welling up for eternal life. ''let them bring me to your holy mountain ''in the place where you dwell. ''across the desert ''and through the mountain ''to the canyon of the crescent moon, to the temple where the cup that. '' ''where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever.'' the holy grail, dr. jones. the chalice used by christ during the last supper. the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathea. the arthur legend. l've heard this bedtime story before. eternal life, dr. jones! the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail. now, that's a bedtime story l'd like to wake up to. an old man's dream. every man's dream, including your father's, l believe. grail lore is his hobby. he's a teacher of medieval literature. the one the students hope they don't get. walter, you're neglecting your guests. be along in a moment, dear. hard to resist, isn't it? the holy grail's final resting place described in detail. what good is it? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. lt's pretty vague. where do you want to start looking? maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing. just the same, an attempt to recover the grail is currently underway. let me tell you another bedtime story, dr. jones. after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade. three brothers, to be exact. l've heard this one, as well. two of these brothers walked out of the desert years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france, but only one of them made it. and before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a. to a franciscan friar, l think. not ''supposedly,'' dr. jones. this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story. lt doesn't reveal the location of the grail, l'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would. this tablet is one of those markers. lt proves the knight's story is true. but as you pointed out, it's incomplete. now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother. our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice, ltaly. as you can now see, dr. jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost , years ago. we're only one step away. that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet. you could be more right than you know. yes? we've hit a snag. our project leader has vanished, along with all his research. uh, we received a cable from his colleague, dr. schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. l want you to pick up the trail where he left off. find the man, and you will find the grail. you've got the wrong jones, mr. donovan. why don't you try my father? we already have. your father is the man who has disappeared. your father and l have been friends since time began. l've watched you grow up, lndy. l've watched the two of you grow apart. l've never seen you this concerned about him before. dad? he's an academic a bookworm. he's not a field man. dad? dad? dear god. what has the old fool got himself into now? l don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head. dad? lt's today's mail, and it's been opened. mail. that's it, marcus. venice, ltaly. what is it? lt's dad's grail diary. every clue he followed. every discovery he made. a complete record of his search for the holy grail. this is his whole life. why would he have sent this to me? l don't know, but someone must want it pretty badly. do you believe, marcus? do you believe the grail actually exists? the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us. but if you want facts, lndy, l've none to give you. at my age, l'm prepared to take a few things on faith. call donovan, marcus. tell him l'll take that ticket to venice now. l'll tell him we'll take two. all right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to venice. don't worry, dr. schneider will be there to meet you. uh, schneider? l maintain an apartment in venice. lt's at your disposal. oh, well, that's good. thank you. dr. jones. good luck. now be very careful. don't trust anybody. signora? signorina? ah, venice. yes. uh, how will we recognize this dr. schneider when we see him? l don't know. maybe he'll know us. dr. jones? yes? l knew it was you. you have your father's eyes. and my mother's ears, but the rest belongs to you. looks like the best parts have already been spoken for. marcus brody? that's right. dr. elsa schneider. oh, how do you do? the last time l saw your father, we were in the library. he was very close to tracking down the knight's tomb. l've never seen him so excited. he was as giddy as a schoolboy. who? attila the professor? he was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy. fraulein, will you permit me? l usually don't. l usually don't, either. ln that case, l permit you. lt would make me very happy. but l'm already sad. by tomorrow, it will have faded. tomorrow l'll steal you another. l hate to interrupt you, but the reason we're here. yes. l have something to show you. l left your father working in the library. he sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city. when l got back to his table, he'd gone, with all his papers, except for that scrap, which l found near his chair. roman numerals. here is the library. that doesn't look much like a library. looks like a converted church. ln this case, it's the literal truth. we are on holy ground. these columns over here were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of byzantium during the crusades. now, please excuse me. the library's closing in a few moments. l'll arrange for us to stay a little longer. marcus. l've seen this window before. where? right here, in dad's diary. you see? look, lndy. the roman numerals. dad was onto something here. well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean. dad sent me this diary for a reason. until we find out why, l suggest we keep it to ourselves. find something? uh, yes. three, seven and ten. that window seems to be the source of the roman numerals. my god, l must be blind. dad wasn't looking for a book about the knight's tomb, he was looking for the tomb itself. don't you get it? the tomb is somewhere in the library. you said yourself it used to be a church. look. three. three. seven. seven. ten. and ten. now where's the ten? look around for the ten. three and seven. seven and seven and ten. ten. ''x'' marks the spot. bingo. you don't disappoint, dr. jones. you're a great deal like your father. except he's lost, and l'm not. lower me down. look after this for me, will you? come on. pagan symbols. fourth or fifth century. right. years before the crusades. the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later. that's right. lf there's a knight of the first crusade down here, that's where we'll find him. what's this one? the ark of the covenant. are you sure? pretty sure. watch out. lt's petroleum. l should sink a well down here and retire. give me the lighter. oh, rats. ugh! come on. come here. look, it. it must be one of these. look at the artistry of these carvings, and the scrollwork. lt's this one. this is it. we found it. look. the engraving on the shield, it's the same as on the grail tablet. the shield is the second marker. what's that? lt's a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet. just like your father giddy as a schoolboy. wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this? he never would have made it past the rats. he hates rats. he's scared to death of them. get back! back against the wall. quick! under it! air pocket! don't wander off. what? what?! l think l've found a way out. deep breath. ah, venice. whoa! are you crazy?! don't go between them! go between them? are you crazy?! l said go around! you said go between them! l said, don't go between them! no! why are you trying to kill us? because you're looking for the holy grail. my father was looking for the holy grail. did you kill him too? no. where is he? talk or you're dead. damn it, tell me! tell me! lf you don't let go, dr. jones, we'll both die. then we'll die. my soul is prepared. how's yours? this is your last chance. no, dr. jones, it's yours. all right, where's my father? lf you let me go, l will tell you where he is. who are you? my name is kazim. and why were you trying to kill me? the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years, and for all that time, the brotherhood of the cruciform sword have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe. let me off at this jetty. ask yourself, why do you seek the cup of christ? ls it for his glory, or for yours? l didn't come for the cup of christ. l came to find my father. ln that case, god be with you in your quest. your father is being held in the castle of brunwald, on the austrian german border. how's the head? lt's better, now l've seen this. lt's the name of a city. ''alexandretta''? hmm. the knights of the first crusade laid siege to the city of alexandretta for over a year. the entire city was destroyed. the present city of lskenderun is built on its ruins. marcus, you remember what the grail tablet said ''across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon.'' but where exactly? your father would know. mm. your father did know. look. he made a map. he must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the grail quest. a map with no names. now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east, here. he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains, here. straight to the canyon. he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. alexandretta. now we know. yes. now we know. marcus, get hold of sallah. tell him to meet you in lskenderun. what about you? l'm going after dad. elsa? elsa? elsa? oh! oh. my room. mine, too. what were they looking for? this. the grail diary? uh huh. you had it? you didn't trust me. l didn't know you. at least l let you tag along. oh, yes. give them a flower, and they'll follow you anywhere. knock it off. you're not mad. no? no. you like the way l do things. lt's lucky l don't do things the same way. you'd still be standing at the venice pier! look, what do you think is going on here? since l met you, l've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. we're caught in the middle of something sinister here. my guess is dad found out more than he was looking for. and until l'm sure, l'm going to continue to do things the way l think they should be done. how dare you kiss me! leave me alone. l don't like fast women. and l hate. arrogant men. ah, venice. what do you know about this place? l know the brunwalds are famous art collectors. what are you going to do? don't know. l'll think of something. yes? and not before time! did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? we're drenched! now look, l've gone and caught a sniffle. are you expected? do not take that tone with me, my good man. now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant. .are here to view the tapestries. tapestries? dear me, the man is dense. this is a castle, isn't it? there are tapestries? this is a castle, and we have many tapestries. but if you are a scottish lord, then l am mickey mouse! how dare he? nazis. l hate these guys. this one. l think he's in here. how do you know? because it's wired. lndy? lndy? don't worry. this is kid's play. l'll be right back. junior? yes, sir. lt is you, junior! don't call me that, please. well, what are you doing here? l came to get you. what do you thi.? late th century, ming dynasty. oh, it breaks the heart. and the head. you hit me, dad. l'll never forgive myself. don't worry, l'm fine. thank god. lt's fake. see, you can tell by the cross section. no! dad, get your stuff. we've got to get out of here. well, l'm sorry about your head, though, but l thought you were one of them. dad, they come in through the doors. good point. but better safe than sorry. hmm, so l was wrong this time. but, by god, l wasn't wrong when l mailed you my diary. you obviously got it. l got it, and l used it. we found the entrance to the catacombs. through the library? right. l knew it. and the tomb of sir richard? found it. he was actually there? you saw him? well, what was left of him. and his shield. the inscription on sir richard's shield? ''alexandretta.'' alexandretta! of course! on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire. oh. junior, you did it. no, dad. you did. forty years. oh, if only l could have been with you. there were rats, dad. rats? yeah, big ones. what do the nazis want with you, dad? they wanted my diary. yeah? l knew l had to get that book as far away from me as l possibly could. yeah. dr. jones. yes? l will take the book now. what book? you have the diary in your pocket. you dolt! do you think my son would be that stupid that he would bring my diary all the way back here? you didn't, did you? you didn't bring it, did you? well, uh. you did. look, can we discuss this later? l should have mailed it to the marx brothers. will you take it easy? take it easy?! why do you think l sent it home in the first place? so it wouldn't fall into their hands! l came here to save you! oh, yeah? and who's gonna come to save you, junior? l told you. .don't call me junior! look what you did! l can't believe what you did. elsa? elsa? that's far enough. put down the gun, dr. jones. put down the gun, or the fraulein dies. but she's one of them. lndy, please! she's a nazi. what?! trust me. lndy, no! l will kill her! yeah? go ahead! no! don't shoot! don't worry. he won't. lndy, please! do what he says! and don't listen to her. enough! she dies! wait! wait. l'm sorry. no, don't be. but. you should have listened to your father. she ransacked her own room, and l fell for it. how did you know she was a nazi? hmm? how did you know she was a nazi? she talks in her sleep. l didn't trust her. why did you? because he didn't take my advice. donovan. didn't l warn you not to trust anybody, dr. jones? l misjudged you, walter. l knew you would sell your mother for an etruscan vase, but l didn't know you would sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity. dr. schneider. there are pages torn out of this. this book contained a map, a map with no names, precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon. so it did. where are these missing pages, this map? we must have these pages back. you're wasting your breath. he won't tell us, and he doesn't have to. lt's perfectly obvious where the pages are. he's given them to marcus brody. marcus? you didn't drag poor marcus along, did you? he's not up to the challenge. he sticks out like a sore thumb. we'll find him. the hell you will. he's got a two day head start on you, which is more than he needs. brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the sudan. he speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. he'll blend in, disappear. you'll never see him again. with any luck, he's got the grail already. does anyone here speak english? or even ancient greek? uh, water? no, thank you, sir. no. fish make love in it. goodness me. thank you so much. no, l don't like that. no, l really don't want. no, no, thank you very much. no, thank you, madam. l'm a vegetarian. does anyone understand a word l'm saying here? mr. brody! oh, sallah. what a relief. marcus brody, sir. but where is lndy? oh, he's in austria. a slight detour. you are on your own? yes, but don't panic. everything's under control. have you, have you arranged our supplies? oh, yes, of course. but where are we going? oh, this map will show you. lt was drawn by, uh. mr. brody. welcome to lskenderun. the director of the museum of antiquities has sent a car for you. oh, well. your servant, sir. and l am his. follow me, please. my reputation precedes me. there is no museum in lskenderun. papers, please. papers? of course. run. yes. papers. got it here. just finished reading it myself. run. yes. ''egyptian mail,'' morning edition. run. did you say, uh. run! okay, okay, quick, quick, quick! find the back door! find the back door! lntolerable. dr. schneider. message from berlin. you must return immediately. a rally at the lnstitute of aryan culture. so? your presence on the platform is requested at the highest level. thank you, herr oberst. l will meet you at lskenderun. take this diary to the reichmuseum in berlin. lt will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. without the map, l'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir. let me kill them now. no. lf we fail to recover the pages from brody, we'll need them alive. always do what the doctor orders. don't look at me like that. we both wanted the grail. l would have done anything to get it. you would have done the same. l'm sorry you think so. l can't forget how wonderful it was. thank you. lt was rather wonderful. oh, dr. schneider. your car is waiting. that's how austrians say good bye. and this is how we say good bye in germany, dr. jones. oh! l liked the austrian way better. so did l. let's try and get these ropes loose. we've got to get to marcus before the nazis do. you said he had two days' start. that he would blend in. disappear. are you kidding? l made that up. you know marcus. he got lost once in his own museum. oh. can you try and reach my left jacket pocket? what am l looking for? my lucky charm. feels like a cigarette lighter. try and burn through the ropes. very good. oh! l ought to tell you something. don't get sentimental now dad. save it till we get out of here. the floor's on fire. see? what? and the chair. move! move it out of here! go! lt's scorching the table! fast! move! okay! well, we have marcus brody, but more important, we have the map. ''by the personal command of the fuhrer. ''secrecy essential to success. eliminate the american conspirators.'' germany has declared war on the jones boys. dad! what? dad! what? dad! what? head for the fireplace! oh. l think l can get these ropes off. whoops. our situation has not improved. listen, dad, l'm almost free. alarm! this is intolerable. l'm out, dad. well done, boy. come on, dad. dead end. there's got to be a. a secret door or a. passageway or something. l find that if l just sit down and think. dad! .the solution presents itself. great. more boats. you say this has been just another typical day for you, huh? no! but better than most. come on, dad. come on. what about the boat? we're not going on the boat? jones! halt! halt! stop! what? stop! stop! you're going the wrong way. we have to get to berlin. brody's this way. my diary's in berlin. we don't need the diary, dad. marcus has the map. there is more in the diary than just the map. all right, dad. tell me. well, he who finds the grail must face the final challenge. what final challenge? three devices of such lethal cunning. booby traps? oh, yes. but l found the clues that will safely take us through, in the chronicles of st. anselm. well, what are they? can't you remember? l wrote them down in my diary so that l wouldn't have to remember. half the german army's on our tail, and you want me to go to berlin? lnto the lion's den? yes. the only thing that matters is the grail. what about marcus? marcus would agree with me. two selfless martyrs. jesus christ. that's for blasphemy. the quest for the grail is not archaeology. lt's a race against evil. lf it is captured by the nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. do you understand me? this is an obsession, dad. l never understood it. never. neither did mom. oh, yes, she did. only too well. unfortunately, she kept her illness from me until all l could do was mourn her. my boy, we are pilgrims in an unholy land. fraulein doctor. where is it? how did you get here? where is it? l want it. you came back for the book? why? my father didn't want it incinerated. ls that what you think of me? l believe in the grail, not the swastika. but you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything that the grail stands for. who gives a damn what you think? you do. all l have to do is squeeze. all l have to do is scream. l've got it. let's get the hell out of here. what did you get? l don't know. first available flight out of germany. good. well, we made it. when we're airborne, with germany behind us, then l'll share that sentiment. relax. tickets, please. guten tag. herr jones. tickets, please. oh, we should get out of here. no ticket. ticket. ticket! ticket! ticket! ticket! you know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience. that's not all we shared. lt's disgraceful. you're old enough to be her fa. her her grandfather. well, l'm as human as the next man. l was the next man. oh. of course. well. ships that pass in the night. do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink, hmm? l had a milkshake. hmm? what did we talk about? we didn't talk. we never talked. do l detect a rebuke? a regret. lt was just the two of us, dad. lt was a lonely way to grow up. for you, too. lf you'd been an ordinary, average father, like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that. actually, l was a wonderful father. when? did l ever tell you to eat up? go to bed? wash your ears? do your homework? no. l respected your privacy, and l taught you self reliance. what you taught me was that l was less important to you than people who'd been dead for years in another country. and l learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for years. you left just when you were becoming interesting. unbelievable. dad, how can you.? very well. l'm here now. what do you want to talk about? hmm? well, l. uh. l can't think of anything. then what are you complaining about? look, we have work to do. when we get to alexandretta, we will face three challenges. the first, ''the breath of god. only the penitent man will pass.'' second, ''the word of god. only in the footsteps of god will he proceed.'' third, ''the path of god. ''only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth.'' what does that mean? l don't know. we'll find out. we're turning around. they're taking us back to germany. well, l thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. come on, dad. move! come on, dad. come on! l didn't know you could fly a plane. fly, yes. land, no. dad, you're going to have to use the machine gun. get it ready. eleven o'clock! dad, eleven o'clock! what happens at eleven o'clock? twelve, eleven, ten. eleven o'clock, fire! dad, are we hit?! more or less. son, l'm sorry. they got us. hang on, dad. we're going in! nice landing. thanks. those people are trying to kill us! l know, dad! well. lt's a new experience for me. lt happens to me all the time. this is intolerable! this could be close. faster, boy! faster! well, they don't come any closer than that! dad, he's coming back! l suddenly remembered my charlemagne.
