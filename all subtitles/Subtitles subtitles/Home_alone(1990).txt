uh huh. even with the kid here? uh huh. i don't think that's a good idea. that house is the only reason we started workin' this block in the first place. ever since i laid eyes on that house, i wanted it. so let's take it one step at a time, okay? we'll unload the van. we'll get a bite to eat. we'll come back about . . this way it's dark then. yeah. kids are scared of the dark. you're afraid of the dark too, marv. you know you are. no, i'm not! yes, you are. i'm not, not, not. you are so. mom, where are you? deck the halls plays, polka style do you play? you want to try it? go ahead. try it. try it. try it. no. okay. excuse me. yeah? hey, nice shoes. oh, thanks. is he still here? it's really important that i see him. he's getting in his car. i guess if you hurry, you can catch him. damn! how low can you get? givin' kris kringle a parking ticket on christmas eve. what's next? rabies shots for the easter bunny? santa, hold on! can i talk to you for a minute? if you make it quick. santa's got a little get together he's late for. okay. i know you're not the real santa claus. what makes you say that? just out of curiosity. i'm old enough to know how it works. all right. but i also know that you work for him. and i'd like you to give him a message. shoot. i'm kevin mccallister, lincoln boulevard. do you need the phone number? no, that's all right. okay. this is extremely important. would you please tell him that, instead of presents this year, i just want my family back. no toys. nothing but peter, kate, buzz, megan, linnie and jeff. and my aunt and my cousins. and, if he has time, my uncle frank. okay? okay. i'll see what i can do. thanks. wait. hold on a second. my elf took the last of the candy canes home to her boyfriend. that's okay. no, no, no. don't be silly. everybody who sees santa has gotta get. somethin'. here. hold out your little paw there. there you go. don't spoil your dinner. i won't. thanks. son of a. merry christmas. huh? may i sit down? that's my granddaughter up there. the little red haired girl. she's about your age. do you know her? no. you live next to me, don't you? yeah. you can say hello when you see me. you don't have to be afraid. there's a lot of things going around about me, but none of it's true. okay? you been a good boy this year? i think so. swear to it? no. yeah, i had a feeling. well, this is the place to be if you're feeling bad about yourself. it is? i think so. are you feeling bad about yourself? no. choir, indistinct i've been kind of a pain lately. i said some things i shouldn't have. i really haven't been too good this year. yeah. i'm kind of upset about it. because i really like my family. even though sometimes i say i don't. sometimes i even think i don't. do you get that? i think so. how you feel about your family is a complicated thing. especially with an older brother. deep down you always love 'em, but you can forget that you love 'em. and you can hurt them, and they can hurt you. and that's not just because you're young. you want to know the real reason that i'm here right now? sure. i came to hear my granddaughter sing, and i can't come and hear her tonight. you have plans? no. i'm not welcome. at church? oh, you're always welcome at church. i'm not welcome with my son. years back, before you and your family moved on the block. i had an argument with my son. how old is he? oh, he's grown up. we lost our tempers. and i said i didn't care to see him anymore. he said the same, and we haven't spoken to each other since. if you miss him, why don't you call him? i'm afraid if i call him, he won't talk to me. how do you know? i don't know. i'm just afraid he won't. no offense, but aren't you a little old to be afraid? you can be a little old for a lot of things. you're never too old to be afraid. that's true. i've always been afraid of our basement. it's dark, there's weird stuff down there, and it smells funny. that sort of thing. it's bothered me for years. basements are like that. then i made myself go down there to do some laundry. and i found out it's not so bad. all this time i've been worrying about it. but if you turn on the lights, it's no big deal. what's your point? my point is you should call your son. what if he won't talk to me? at least you'll know. then you could stop worrying about it. and you won't have to be afraid anymore. i don't care how mad i was, i'd talk to my dad. especially around the holidays. i don't know. just give it a shot. for your granddaughter anyway. i'm sure she misses you. and the presents. i send her a check. i wish my grandparents sent that. they always send me clothes. last year i got a sweater with a big bird knitted on it. oh, that's nice. not for a guy in the second grade. you can get beat up for wearing something like that. oh? yeah. i have a friend who got nailed 'cause there was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas. you'd better run along home where you belong. you think about what i said. all right? okay. it was nice talking to you. nice talking to you. what about you? me? yeah. you and your son. we'll see what happens. merry christmas. merry christmas. continues, indistinct this is my house. i have to defend it. okay, we'll check it out first. we can always come back for the truck. how do you wanna go in?
