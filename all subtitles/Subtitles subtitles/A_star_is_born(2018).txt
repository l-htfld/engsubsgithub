'cause you gotta figure, it's just me and him all day long. my brother's out there tryin' to make something of himself. so i took one of his belts. i put it around the ceiling fan and tried to do the deed. the whole fucking fan came out of the ceiling. had a big cut on my fucking forehead. i was more mad about that than it not working. and he didn't even notice. he didn't even fucking notice.

'cause when you met me, you were drinking, and now you're not. i wasn't drunk the whole time we were together. i know, but. but it got bad when we were together. it's okay. i mean, it's fine. i just was wondering, that's all, and whatever you want is okay. whatever i want?

no, i wouldn't. i wouldn't say i was hiding it. i just. i started puttin' it down to paper when we were at home. i don't know, it just sort of fell out of me, i guess, and onto this page. and i put it in here, and i thought. i thought maybe you'd find it when you came back to you, maybe. well, i found it. listen. i'm, uh. i'm sorry. it's okay. i. it's okay. it's not your fault. i'm sorry i did that. it's okay. it's not your fault. it's a disease. no, but i embarrassed you. i embarrassed you, and i. i'm not embarrassed of you. it was so wrong. and then your dad. my father loves you, it's okay. i know, but i. it's okay. i know, but i. it's okay. it's okay. i have figured out what i think is the best solution for both of us. jack should come out on tour with me. we'll start with our duets. i know he's gonna be able to play by himself. you realize that's not an option. he's so inside of his art in a way he has never been. he can hear himself again. ally, there is no way that you can take jack on tour with you. there is no way. do you understand what i'm saying? you know what? if you can't make that happen, then fucking cancel the tour. i don't know what to tell you. i think if we had a better band name, we might've made it. or maybe it was 'cause we looked like a father and son duo. not many of those around. i was not a good look for you, that's for sure. not my fault i couldn't find a better guitar player in the whole goddamn state. where in the fuck is it? right here. thanks for the ride. sure thing, jack. hey, you know, uh. when i, um. when i said i would. you know, when i. took your voice, you know. it's you i idolized. it wasn't dad. what was that guy? hey. hey. i wanna know how you hear this. that sounded unbelievable, what you were playing. thank you. it's nice to hear it. thank you, and i had the beautiful backdrop of you and charlie. i only heard it in my mind for so many weeks, so it's good to hear it. the words are beautiful. in the real thing. in the real thing. well, you want me to do that? mmm hmm. oh, god, i don't know. i knew you were gonna ask me. back from the dead. hey, sorry. were you waiting long? hey, jack. no, no. uh. ally's not home. no, i told her i'd meet her here, if that's okay. of course, yeah. here you go. hey, thanks for taking care of my girl when i was gone. anything for her. she told me about that european leg. that's a hell of an accomplishment this soon out of the gate. shit, i remember it was like ten years before i even went across the pond. it was summer, . shit, was it? we're not exactly friends here. while you've been away, we've been back here in serious triage, trying to clean up your fucking mess. barely finding our way through it. you almost single handedly derailed her whole career. you understand that? she's never gonna say this to you. she loves you too much. just by staying married to you, she looks like a joke. it's embarrassing. let's be honest, we both know it's only a matter of time before that's pushed aside again for the real thing. and when that happens, i don't want her anywhere near you. hey. i have some good news. yeah? mmm hmm. i'm not gonna go to europe. we're gonna cancel the rest of the tour, and i'm just gonna be here all summer. isn't that great? what happened? nothing happened. the label just loves the record, and it's doing so well, and they wanna keep with the momentum and have me make another one. rez is super psyched, so it'll be great. so tonight's gonna be my last show. going out with a bang at the forum. great. yeah. why don't you come with me? we can sing shallow together. the fans will go crazy to see you. come on, cowboy. yeah, why not? okay. yeah? okay, good. i'll have a car come get you. once i get there. i'll go meet you there. i'll see you soon, okay?

is he here? he's not here. he's not here? we have to do shallow regardless, okay? the guitar's up there. everything's gonna remain the same, okay? what? the guitar's up there. everything's gonna remain the same. both verses. i'm sure it was just a bit much for him, that's all. please send somebody to the house, please. i'm doing it right now. i have seconds. in the shallow in the shallow in the shallow we're far from the shallow now give it up for my husband, jackson. i can stay, if you want. some kid started singing one of his songs in a bar i was in the other night. they're playing his songs everywhere. at first i got angry. i don't know why. i guess i felt like, how can any of these people feel like they knew him? who he really was. but then something changed. and it soothed me. that it wasn't all for fucking nothing. the last thing i did was lie to him. listen to me. it isn't your fault. it just isn't. you know whose fault it was? jack. that's it. no one else. not you, not me. no one but jack. i just keep going over and over it, over it in my head. jack talked about how music is essentially notes between any octave. notes and the octave repeats. it's the same story. told over and over. forever. all any artist can offer the world is how they see those notes. that's it. he loved how you see them. he just kept saying, i love how she sees them, bobby. hello, i'm ally maine. thank you for being here tonight to honor my husband. he wrote a song for me. i'd like to sing it for him tonight. and with your help, maybe i can. thank you. really. thank you
