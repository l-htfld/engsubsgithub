you look tired. i had another tussle with potter today. i thought when we put him on the board of directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit. what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway? he's a sick man, frustrated, sick in his mind. sick in his soul, if he has one. he hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. he hates us mostly, i guess. gangway. gangway. so long, pop. so long. you got a match? very funny, very funny. put those things in the car, and i'll get your tie and studs ready for you. now, hurry up. okay, mom. now, don't drop one of those. you coming later, george? what do you mean, and be bored to death?

did i act like that when i graduated from high school? pretty much. you know, george, i wish we could send harry to college with you. your mother and i talked it over half the night. we have that all figured out. you see, harry will take my job at the building and loan, work there for four years, then he'll go. pretty young for that job. well, no younger than i was. well, you were born older, george. how's that? i said you were born older. i suppose you've decided what you want to do when you get out of college. well, you know what i've always talked about, build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities. all that stuff i've been talking about. still after that first million before you're ? i'll settle for half that in cash. of course, it's just a hope. but you wouldn't consider coming back to the building and loan, would you? well, i. i. annie, why don't you draw up a chair? then you'd be more comfortable, and you could hear everything that's going on. i would if i thought i'd hear anything worth listening to. you would, eh? i know it's soon to talk about it. no, now, pop, i couldn't. i couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office. i'm sorry, pop. i didn't mean that, but i. it's this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe. i'd go crazy. i want to do something big and something important. you know, george, i feel that, in a small way, we're doing something important, satisfying a fundamental urge. it's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace. and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office. i know, pop. i know that. i wish i felt that. i've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to. most of my friends have already finished college. i just feel like if i didn't get away, i'd bust. yes, yes, you're right, son. you see what i mean, don't you, pop? this town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to potter. now, you've got talent, son. i've seen it. you get yourself an education and get out of here. pop, you want a shock? i think you're a great guy. why, did you hear that, annie? i heard it. it's about time one of you lunkheads said it. i'm gonna miss old annie. pop, i think i'll get dressed and go over to harry's party. have a good time, son. excuse me. there you are. george, hello. you know my kid brother george. i'm gonna put him through college. hello, george. hee haw! sam wainwright. how are you?

'cause they know what kind of a guy i am. you remember george. this is mary. well, i'll be seeing you. well, well, well. now to get back to my story, see? hey, this is my dance. why don't you stop annoying people?

hey, you're wonderful. what's the matter, othello? jealous? did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor? and did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up? and did you further know that george bailey is dancing right over that crack?

i guess i'm not quite the football type. you look wonderful! you know, if it wasn't me talking, i'd say you were the prettiest girl in town. well, why don't you say it? i don't know. maybe i will say it. how old are you anyway?

i wouldn't live in it as a ghost. now, watch. right in the second floor, there. see? what did you wish, george? not just one wish, a whole hatful. mary, i know what i'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that. i'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and i'm gonna see the world! italy, greece, the parthenon, the coliseum. then i'm coming back here and go to college to see what they know. and then i'm gonna build things. i'm gonna build airfields. i'm gonna build skyscrapers stories high. i'm gonna build bridges a mile long. what, are you gonna throw a rock? hey, that's pretty good. what did you wish, mary? buffalo gals can't you come out tonight? can't you come out tonight? buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon? what did you wish when you threw that rock? oh, no. come on, tell me. if i told you, it might not come true. what is it you want, mary? what do you want? you want the moon? just say the word, and i'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. hey, that's a pretty good idea. i'll give you the moon, mary. i'll take it. then what? well, then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve, see? and the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair. am i talking too much? yes! why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? how's that? why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? you want me to kiss her, huh? youth is wasted on the wrong people. hey. hey, hold on, hey, mister. come on back out here! i'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. what are you. mary? okay, i give up. where are you? over here in the hydrangea bushes. here you are. catch. wait a minute. what am i doing? this is a very interesting situation. please give me my robe. a man doesn't get in a situation like this every day. i'd like to have my robe. not in bedford falls, anyway. ouch! oh! gesundheit. george bailey! this requires a little thought here. give me my robe. i've read about things like this, but i've never. shame on you! i'm gonna tell your mother on you. my mother's way up on the corner there. i'll call the police. they're way downtown. they'd be on my side, too. then i'm going to scream! maybe i could sell tickets. let's see. no, the point is in order to get this robe. i've got it. i'll make a deal with you, mary. george! george! george, come on home! quick! your father's had a stroke. what? mary, mary, i'm sorry. i've got to go. come on, george, let's hurry. did you get a doctor? yes. campbell's there now. i think that's all we'll need you for, george. i know you're anxious to make a train. i have a taxi waiting downstairs. i want the board to know that george gave up his trip to europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. good luck to you at school, george. good luck, george. goodbye, george. and now we come to the real purpose of this meeting, to appoint a successor to our dear friend peter bailey. mr. chairman, i'd like to get to my real purpose. wait just a minute now. wait for what? i claim this institution is not necessary to this town. therefore, mr. chairman, i make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver. potter, you dirty, contemptible. i'll wring his neck. george, did you hear what that buzzard. mr. chairman. it's too soon after peter bailey's death to talk about chloroforming the building and loan. peter bailey died three months ago. i second mr. potter's motion. very well. in that case, i'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. but before you go, i'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of peter bailey. thank you very much. it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization. i'll go further than that. i'll say that to the public peter bailey was the building and loan. that's fine, potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave. peter bailey was not a businessman. that's what killed him. oh, i don't mean any disrespect to him. god rest his soul. he was a man of high ideals, so called. but ideals without common sense can ruin this town. now, you take this loan here to ernie bishop, you know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know. i happen to know the bank turned down this loan. but he comes here, and we're building him a house worth , . why? well, i handled that, mr. potter. you have all the papers there. his salary, insurance. i can personally vouch for his character. a friend of yours? yes, sir. you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say. just a minute. just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you're right when you say my father was no businessman. i know that. why he ever started this cheap penny ante building and loan i'll never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was. why, in the years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. isn't that right, uncle billy? he didn't save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what's wrong with that? why, here, you're all businessmen here. don't it make them better citizens, and doesn't it make them better customers? you said that they. what'd you say just a minute ago? they had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home. wait? wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they're so old and broken down that they. do you know how long it takes a working man to save , ? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father didn't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be. i'm not interested in your book. i'm talking about the building and loan. i know very well what you're talking about. you're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. that's what you're talking about, i know. well, i've said too much. i. you're the board here. you do what you want with this thing. there's just one thing more, though. this town needs this measly one horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to potter. come on, uncle billy. sentimental hogwash. i want my motion. boy, oh boy, that was telling him, george, old boy. you shut his big mouth. you should have heard him. what happened? we heard a lot of yelling. well, we're being voted out of business after years. easy come, easy go. here it is. help wanted. female. you still want me to hang around, george? yeah, i'll be right down. yeah, hey, you'll miss your train. you're a week late for school already. go on. what's going on in there? never mind. don't worry about that. they're putting us out of business. so what? i can get another job. i'm only . . go on, go on. hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college, too, do you? george! george! they voted potter down. they want to keep it going. you did it, george. you did it. they got one condition, only one condition. what's that? and that's the best part of it. they've appointed george here as executive secretary to take his father's place. oh, no! but, uncle billy. you can keep him on. that's all right. as secretary, you can hire anyone you like. dr. campbell, now let's get this thing straight. i'm leaving. i'm leaving right now. i'm going to school. this is my last chance. uncle billy here, he's your man. but, george, they'll vote with potter otherwise. i know, i know, he didn't go. that's right. not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, harry, and sent him to college. harry became a football star. made second team all american. yeah, but what happened to george? george got four years older, waiting for harry to come back and take over the building and loans. there are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel. look at this. here. venezuela oil fields. wanted, man with construction experience. here's the yukon, right here. wanted, man with engineering experience. there she blows. you know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are? breakfast is served. lunch is served. dinner. no, no, no, no! anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles. peanut? there's the professor now. old professor phi beta kappa all american bailey. why, old george geographic explorer bailey. what? no husky dogs? no sled? uncle billy, you haven't changed a bit. nobody ever changes here, you know that. oh, am i glad to see you. say, where's mother? she's home, cooking the fatted calf. come on, let's go. oh, wait! wait, wait a minute. george, uncle billy, i want you to meet ruth. hello. how do you do? ruth dakin. ruth dakin bailey, if you don't mind. huh? well, i wired you i had a surprise. here she is. meet the wife. well, what do you know? a wife. well, how do you do? congratulations. how do you do? what am i doing? congratulations! doggone it, harry, you. they're married! why don't you tell somebody? come on, mrs. bailey, i can't wait to see everybody's reaction. you're really married? why, yes. what's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two headed brother of mine? well, i'll tell you. it's purely mercenary. my father offered him a job. oh, he got you and the job? well, harry's cup runneth over. george, about that job. ruth spoke out of turn. i never said i'd take it. you've been holding the bag here for four years, and, well, i won't let you down, george. i would like to. oh, wait a minute. i forgot the bags. i'll be right back. it was a surprise to me. this is the new mrs. bailey, my nephew's wife. how are you? old, old friend of the baileys. oh, really? what are their names? let's see. oh, of course, i've heard him speak of you. and i want to tell you, we're gonna give the biggest party this town ever saw. here, have some popcorn. george, george, george. that's all harry ever talks about. ruth, this. what about this job? well, my father owns a glass factory in buffalo. he wants to get harry started in the research business. well, is it a good job? oh, yes, very. not much money, but good future, you know. yeah. harry's a genius at research. my father just fell in love with him. and you did, too. hey, joe. oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. i feel so good. i could spit in potter's eye. i think i will. i think i will. what did you say? huh? maybe i'd better go home. where's my hat? where's my. oh, thank you, george. which is mine? the middle one. oh, thank you, george. oh boy, oh boy. now, look, if you'll point me in the right direction. would you do that, george?

then what, honey? after that, who cares? that does it, come here. come here. don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, george. i've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run. hey, ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry. george, let's not stop. let's go! just a minute, dear. please, let's not stop, george. i'll be back in a minute, mary. well, hello, everybody. mrs. thompson, how are you? charlie? what's the matter here, can't you get in? what is this, uncle billy? a holiday? george. come on in, everybody. that's right. just come on in. look out, you. now, look, why don't you all sit down? there are a lot of seats over there. just make yourselves at home. george, can i see you a minute? why didn't you call me? i just did, but they said you left. this is a pickle, george. this is a pickle. all right, now, what happened? how did it start? how does a thing like this ever start? all i know is the bank called our loan. when? about an hour ago. i handed over all our cash. all of it? every cent of it, and still it was less than we owe them. holy mackerel! and then i got scared, george, and closed the doors. i. i. the whole town's gone crazy. yeah, hello? george, it's potter. hello? george, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors. is that true? oh, well, i'm very glad to hear that. george, are you all right? do you need any police? police? what for? well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. george, i'm going all out to help in this crisis. i've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. they'll close up for a week and then reopen. he just took over the bank. i may lose a fortune, but i'm willing to guarantee your people, too. just tell them to bring their shares over here, and i will pay cents on the dollar. you never miss a trick, do you, potter? well, you're gonna miss this one. if you close your doors before p. m., you will never reopen. george, was it a nice wedding? gosh, i wanted to be there. yeah. you can take this one off now. now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appeared. i have some news for you, folks. i was just talking to old man potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank. the bank's gonna reopen next week. but, george, i got my money here. did he guarantee this place? well, no, charlie. i didn't even ask him. we don't need potter over here. then, i'll take mine now. no, but you're. you're thinking of this place all wrong, as if i had the money back in a safe. the money's not here. well, your money's in joe's house. that's right next to yours. and in the kennedy house and mrs. macklin's house and others. why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're gonna pay it back to you as best they can. now, what are you gonna do, foreclose on them? i got in here, and isn't going to break anybody. okay, tom. all right. here you are. you sign this. you'll get your money in days. sixty days? now, that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares. tom! tom, did you get your money? no. well, i did. old man potter'll pay cents on the dollar for every share you've got. fifty cents on the dollar! yes, cash! well, what do you say? now, tom, you have to stick to your original agreement. now, give us days on this. okay, randall. are you going to go to potter's? better to get half than nothing. tom! tom! randall! now, randall, wait! wait. now, listen. now, listen to me. i beg of you not to do this thing. if potter gets a hold of this building and loan, there'll never be another decent house built in this town. he's already got charge of the bank. he's got the bus line. he got the department stores. and now he's after us. why? well, it's very simple. because we're cutting in on his business, that's why. and because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. joe, you had one of those potter houses, didn't you? well, have you forgotten? have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken down shack? here, ed, you know. you remember last year when things weren't going so well and you couldn't make your payments. well, you didn't lose your house, did you? you think potter would've let you keep it? can't you understand what's happening here? don't you see what's happening? potter isn't selling. potter's buying, and why? because we're panicky and he's not. that's why. he's picking up some bargain. now we can get through this thing all right. we've got to stick together, though. we've got to have faith in each other. but my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and i need money. how am going to live until the bank opens? i got doctor bills to pay. i need cash. i can't feed my kids on faith. how much do you need? hey! i got , . here's , . this'll tide us over till the bank reopens. all right, tom, how much do you need? . tom, just enough to tide you over until the bank reopens. i'll take . there you are. that'll close my account. your account's still here. that's a loan. okay. all right, ed? i got here, george. now, ed, what'll it take till the bank opens? what do you need? well, i suppose . . now you're talking. thanks, ed. that's fine. all right, now, mrs. thompson, how much do you want? but it's your own money, george. never mind about that. how much do you want? i can get along with , all right. , fine. and i'll sign the paper. you don't have to sign anything. i know you. you pay it when you can. that's okay. all right, mrs. davis? could i have . ? bless your heart. of course you can have it. you got cents?

even though they know the baileys never made a dime out of it. you know very well why. the baileys were all chumps. every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the building and loan to build. if i were you, mr. potter. you are not me. as i say, it's no skin off my nose, but one of these days this bright young man is gonna be asking george bailey for a job. the bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough. yes, sir? come in here. we just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're gonna drive on down to florida. why don't you have your friends join us? why, sure. hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?

now, what's your point, mr. potter? my point? my point is i want to hire you. hire me? yeah, i want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. george, i'll start you out at , a year. , a year? you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to new york a year, maybe once in a while europe. you wouldn't mind that, would you, george?
