allie. it's okay, allie. you know, sometimes that's what people do. they try and silence those of us who ask questions. but you know what? in the end, we're the ones who change the world. take good care of that, allie. guys, this is dr. skirth. say hi. hi. hello, kids. um, sorry to interrupt, but it's time to get changed for your interview. yeah. uh, kids, sorry to leave you. allie, you're in charge. high five up top. dr. skirth will answer allie's question, and any others. see you next time, guys. bye! bye! what do you say, mr. drake, we just start at the beginning? born to british parents. mmm hmm. and then at , you discovered a gene therapy that literally doubles the life expectancy of pancreatic cancer patients. well, actually, it tripled their life expectancy. but it's okay. okay, um, . that's still extremely young. all right, you create the life foundation! it didn't happen overnight. and then. rockets. you then decide, like any normal human being, that you're gonna go and explore space. you know what it is? i have always believed. uh huh. .that space exploration is crucial in our quest to cure everything that ails us here on earth. but if you think about everything we've found. uh huh. .in the oceans and on land, isn't it time to look up there? mmm hmm. to this plethora of untapped resources? and you have a plethora of untapped resources, also, from your pharmaceutical companies that you're involved with, you know, to help you realize that ambition, i suppose. of course. yeah. full circle. so, i have to ask, how does that work, you know, exactly, the life foundation thing? how does it. how does it, um. i don't know, how does it go about, say, testing pharmaceuticals? eddie, we're talking about the rocket here. no, i'm not. i'm not. i'm talking about the allegations. i'm sorry, i don't. it says that your entire empire has been built on dead bodies. eddie. it's true, right? it says that you recruit the most vulnerable of us to volunteer for tests. hmm. .that more often than not end up killing people. yeah, i'm aware of these rumors online. there's a lot of fake news out there these days. right. what about the legal cases? sorry? uh, the actual legal cases, like sarah chambers, phil barclay, rob macdonald. that's it. time to go. thank you so much for coming to talk to me, mr. brock. and they're just some of the people who walked through these doors. have a nice day. cut the camera off, please. thank you very much. time is up. come on. they're dead. the dead. could you show him out, please?

excuse me? who's your source, eddie? i don't have a source, per se. but i have a hunch. this isn't the wild wild west. we don't go off half cocked based on a hunch. we do the work. we substantiate our accusations. we provide evidence. you know, for a smart guy, you really are a dumb ass. you're fired, eddie. i can't trust you. have a nice life. will just take a second. okay. hey. you are pathologically self absorbed. annie. annie, can you talk to me first? your ego requires constant attention, and you're stubborn as hell. but i was willing to roll with it, eddie, because i loved you. you loved me? what is that supposed to mean? what you did got me fired. you used me. annie? annie. oh, my god. you're beautiful. test . biological interactions between two different organisms. these creatures need to bond with a respiratory host in order to survive for any amount of time in an oxygen rich environment. well, why are all these hosts showing this hyper acute rejection? that's what we're trying to find out. the bonding process is starting. it's equalizing. but why? why this rabbit? it's similar to an organ transplant. huh. where the donor and recipient must be an exact match? that's correct. okay. so wait, think about it. if we do achieve symbiosis, they should be able to survive here, but also we would be able to survive there. we ? begin human trials. oh, it's way too soon to even begin to think about something like. dr. skirth, you're at the forefront of a scientific breakthrough. i need you to hold your nerve. all right? i understand, but it's an ethical question. think of future generations. think of your kids. hey, how are your kids? let's begin human trials. good work. hey, jack. do you ever feel like your life is like one monumental screwup? nope. here at the life foundation, we've always believed. isn't that your buddy? .in finding the lessons in our disappointments. in the months since our rocket failed, we've learned so much. do you think we could, like, switch him off? some people are trying to watch that. oh, you are, are you? yeah? aren't you eddie brock? i used to be. we take the same view of progress. thrilled to announce that the life foundation has now begun preparations on its next launch. all right, jack, this is for you. i do not want you to spend it all at once. i'm going to go home and chase myself around the room, playing hard to get. hey, maria. eddie. how's it going?

i don't know. and you know what? even if i did, i wouldn't tell you anyway. i don't trust you, and you're insane. that hurts. sorry. long journal entry about that tonight. you're being dumb, brock. i'm not insane. what's insane is the way humans choose to live today. think about it. all we do is take, take, take. it can't go on. we've brought the planet to the brink of extinction. we're parasites. you're a good example. think about it. all you do is take. you took my symbiote. you take potshots at a great man trying to get something done. who? didn't you take from the person you loved the most, who trusted you the most? that's insane. what i've initiated is a whole new world, a new species. man and symbiote combined. let me tell you something, buddy. all right? just man to man. because i have spent a significant amount of time, all right, with one of these creatures up my ass. it's not a lot of fun. and then i find out, all along, that they're killing you. this is the last time i'm asking you. where is my symbiote? i have no idea. where is he? oh, my god! where's venom? that is the ugliest looking thing i have ever seen. you know, brock, i have no use for you. treece! come and clean up your mess. whoa, he has one up his ass, too. your friends, the others, i apologize. i tried to keep them alive. there are more of us. millions more. they will follow wherever i lead. where we lead. yes, we. but first, we must retrieve them. i can take care of that. yeah, what you gonna do, you gonna walk me to death? shut up. not so tough without your friend. did your mama not love you? god damn it! i guess it pays to be a specialist, huh? you know, it doesn't matter if you kill me anyway, because there's something way bigger afoot in this world than you and me. much bigger than me. and it's much, much bigger than you. karma's a bitch. i don't believe in karma. oh! ooh! hi, eddie. whoa. whoa. oh. mmm. mmm! oh, no. i just bit that guy's head off. i know, i know. i've been there, too. it's not fun. the one with drake is riot. who's riot? riot is what you would call a team leader. he has an arsenal of weapons. drake's got his own symbiote. he is unstoppable. oh, great. we have got to go! go where? where we going? well, i'm coming with you. no! it's going to get ugly. well, she can fight ugly. trust me. yeah, i can fight ugly. not today. oh, that's bullshit! this is not a simulation. well, the flight team aren't prepped yet. i'll be piloting the spacecraft. you? yes, me. how long? we're loading the probe and running diagnostics. but even fully automated, you can't pilot that craft all alone. i'm not alone. god damn it! what the hell happened there? we just left annie. it is not safe for her. if we do not stop riot, he will come back here with millions more of my kind. millions? what, you were gonna take the rocket, and you were gonna come back here with an invasion force? then what were you gonna do, you were gonna go feed on a whole planet? yes! but it is different now, eddie. i have decided to stay. wow! on my planet, i am kind of a loser, like you. but here, we could be more. excuse me? and i'm getting to like it here. oh, you like us now, do you, huh? however, there will be nothing left to like if we do not stop that rocket. oh, i see. right. when it comes to being completely annihilated, then it's back to we. it is we. like it or not, it is going to take both of us. hey, come on, man. cut the bullshit. what really made you change your mind? you. you did, eddie. scrub diagnostics. sir? did you hear me? initiate the launch. t minus five minutes to launch. auto sequence has been initiated. oh, shit. t minus four minutes, seconds. oh, jesus! you can take this guy, right? he has got shit you have never seen. what does that mean? what are our chances? hmm. pretty much zero. oh, fuck it. well, let's go save the planet. t minus four minutes. initiate orbiter aerosurface profile. venom. get in the rocket. no. we won't let you destroy this world. then die. holy shit! told you. t minus three minutes. you have a strong host. but not strong enough. t minus two minutes, seconds. eddie. drake, stop! told you i could fight ugly. t minus one minute. you're too late. this is the next stage. you talk too much. t minus seconds. you are nothing. ten seconds. nine. eight. seven. six. five. four. three. two. one. liftoff. traitor! have a nice life. goodbye, eddie. venom, no! hmm. you're in luck. i've decided to work pro bono. i'm joining the public defenders' office. you're a good person, annie. what about you? what are you gonna do? uh, the network asked me to bring the show back, and they want to start with a piece on drake. oh, wow, really? so, what did you say? uh, i'm not into it. i want to concentrate on the written word. i scored the interview of a lifetime. oh, yeah? who? you're gonna have to read it. oh! like everyone else. yeah. hey, i'm sorry about venom. hey, um. do you want to talk about that kiss? oh, that? you call that a kiss. no, that was. uh, that was your buddy's idea. oh, right. well, that is good to know. it did feel kind of great, though. what? i mean, the. the power? yeah. when it's, you know. inside you? you know what i mean. okay. hey, eddie? mmm hmm? we're not gonna tell dan about this. okay? look at her. she has no idea we are going to get her back. no, i don't think so. sorry, what was that? we're not gonna tell dan. eddie, is there something you want to tell me? nope. you belong with us, annie. eddie, are you sure? good lord, look at that. look at the time. i have to go. hey, it's nice seeing you. yeah. you take care, all right? yeah, you take care of yourself. bye. hey. don't give up on her. either of you. we won't. who is that guy? okay. wait. this thing looks delicious. i have absolutely no problem with you sticking around, but if you do, we're gonna have to have some ground rules, all right? you cannot just go around eating anybody that you want to. i cannot? no, you cannot. all right, we need to. we need to reiterate this. there are good people in this world, a lot of them. and then there are bad people. you have to tell the difference. the deal is, you will only ever be allowed to touch, harm, hurt, possibly, very possibly, eat very, very bad people, but never, ever, ever good people. all right? fine. good. but how does one tell the difference? well, it's super simple. i mean, you just have to. you can intuit it, you can sense it. sometimes you can even feel it. whatever you say. but can we get something to eat now? otherwise, your liver, it's starting to look really, really good and juicy. yeah. definitely. i know a place down here. hey, mrs. c. how you doing, eddie? ain't nothing changed but the weather. you know. no. so, what culinary delights will tickle the pickle tonight? tater tots and chocolate. right. okay, no problem. the payment's due, chen. please. i can't keep doing this. now. bad guy, right? yep. you come in here again. in fact, you go anywhere in this city, preying on innocent people, and we will find you and eat both your arms and then both of your legs. no, no. and then we will eat your face right off your head. do you understand? please. yes. so, you will be this armless, legless, faceless thing, won't you, rolling down the street, like a turd in the wind? do you feel me? what the hell are you? we are venom. on second thought. please. eddie? what was that? oh. i have a parasite. yeah. night, mrs. chen. parasite ? yeah. it's a term of endearment, that's all. apologize! no. apologize! all right, fine. i'm sorry. so, what do you want to do now? the way i see it, we can do whatever we want. i need you to stay quiet. this is a me thing. it is not a we thing. you got that? fine, but make it quick. open on five. go. opening up. you ask me, they're dumb to let him call the shots. second he asked for you to interview him, i'd have shut that shit down. oh, yeah, you know the fbi. they're just taking advantage of the one and only time he'll ever speak to anyone. they're hoping that i might help them identify some additional bodies. fbi don't work up close and personal with him. the fbi will have to identify you, if you don't follow the rules. hey, red! i got a visitor for you. hi, eddie. hey. do you mind if we forego the whole creepy serial killer thing here? sure, it's good with me. i mean, i can turn it on if you want. i can talk about the dadaist patterns of arterial spray. i bet you can. tough to see you in this light, eddie. come on over. all right. i'm here. when i get out of here, and i will, there's gonna be carnage
