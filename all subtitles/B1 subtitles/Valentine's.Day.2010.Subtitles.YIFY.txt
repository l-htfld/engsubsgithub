it has to happen. i mean, we have a chance to make it happen. but did you hear what you said, make it happen ? we shouldn't have to make it happen. look, sit. this is so sweet, and. look, alex, i love you. i just. i really think we should wait. i'm sorry. it's okay. i love you too. and. .we can still make out. bye. paula thomas. whoever this is better have a good reason for calling me this late. you want me to do what? boy, do you know who you're talking to? oh ho ho ho. vladimir. well, let me tell you something, vladimir. you don't know what rough is until you've dealt with a true african queen. let me get my stick. kneel to nzinga! attention, i'm going home now. but i wanted to say goodnight to the world's greatest boss. .and tell him that we all love him. good night, nikki. you saw. yeah. i'd like to take to comment on the story that we broke earlier. quarterback sensation sean jackson. .has popped the lock on the closet and come out. what does this mean? will there be more house music played in the locker room? these questions aside, mr. jackson's name is likely to be remembered. .alongside jackie robinson, muhammad ali, and billie jean king. .who endured their share of trash talking as well. but let's allow future generations to decide where to place sean jackson in history. it's not about defiance. .it's about what a man will do for love. i stand behind you, sean. metaphorically. oh, jeez. thank you. good night. and that's it for tonight's news. happy valentine's day to all of you. sherry donaldson for kvla, channel . good. hey, man. excellent. hey, way to go, bro. cue music, cue logo. you sneaky little cupid. you got romantic after all, didn't you? i may get a few letters on that, but i got your back. thank you. happy valentine's day, kelvin. same to you. well, those stairs never looked so good. interesting perspective on sean jackson. just a second. who is it? you forgot your camera. can i come in? sure. jason, i feel bad about how you found out about my job. it was awkward, and i'm sorry. but that is the only thing that i apologize for. no. i should be the one apologizing. if you want to be a adult phone entertainer. .that's cool. i don't know, jason. when you found out something about me you didn't like, you judged me and bailed. i don't think that's a promising foundation for a relationship. you know what? you're right. i just spent all night in a cemetery. and i actually learned something. in a relationship. .you have to accept the other person. .for all of what they are, not just the parts that are easy to like. and you're stupid if you turn your back on something as important. .as. .iove. so i bought this for you. at the store. and this one goes. sugar can't answer the phone right now. she's got to make love to her boyfriend on valentine's day. and, for the record, this is what i like. simple. yeah. let's just keep it really simple. i also like make up sex. whoa, what a coincidence. you too? me too. yay! hi. sorry. yeah. what are you doing with the flowers? they're all the ones that nobody wants. so you're giving them a second life? yeah, most shops throw them away. i like the idea that tomorrow, somebody's gonna see them floating by and. yeah. wonder where they come from. and the mystery of it all. i used to actually put them together. .and practice new designs with them. .and drop them off at a random doorstep with a note saying somebody out there loves you. then i got to thinking. .what if they found out that someone was me? would they want me to be the one that loves them? i would. .want that. am i about to kiss my best friend? i hope so. not great. that was awkward. awkward. just not great. yep. but this is my old. where i get down. this is your spot. you really helped me out. susan is. giving me a chance to be number one. congratulations. thank you, again. thank you. i'm gonna have to teach you. that is. no. i'll teach you this. it's not natural. keep the fist. it's a little. thank you. okay. no, no, no. open your. open. you know what? i got a better idea. not happening. okay. that was nice. well, you didn't exactly, like, knock it out of the park. well, we've never practiced, you have to admit. maybe we should practice, then. okay. mommy! you're so big. you're so big. did you imagine it better or worse? i did. you imagined it better? i gave you more credit. really? yeah. well, i hate that i'm not living up to my. well, i don't know. it's romeo midnight, one last time. only seconds left now before it's just another day. so count it down with me, lovers. and raise your glass to those three little words that we all want to hear let's get naked. i never had a inkling before, man. i didn't know what to do. i need to get to the airport. stupid.! vladimir! let me get my whip. you know i always wanna answer yours first. oh! just. let's do. i never had a inkling before. i didn't know what to do with it. shoot, we gotta get to the. it's stupid. stupid seat belt! oh, there's a. hold it, there's a finger in there. you on facebook?
