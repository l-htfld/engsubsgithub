 what? god. i'm so sorry. are you okay? you know, there are easier ways to kill me if you're worried i'll rat you out for cheating on the lsats. what? come on. rachel. unbelievable. rachel. oh, god. rachel. come on. let me buy you a fresh cup. you actually going to buy it this time, or are you going to steal it? okay, first of all, i don't steal. i cheat. there's a big difference. and i don't do it anymore. oh, great defense. i'm sorry, your honor. i know that i murdered her, but i promise i won't do it anymore. look, i understand why you're mad but i still don't think you're being entirely fair. not fair? what's not fair is that you repeatedly help people skirt a system that stands in the way of me becoming a lawyer. you know what? why don't you give up the whole saint act since the only reason you figured out i was cheating is because you were thinking about cheating yourself. thinking about cheating and actually doing it are two very different things, dr. analogy. oh. whoa. did i miss an apocalypse? where is everyone? you know, for someone with a freak brain, you manage to forget everything important. follow me. but don't talk to me. oh. not bad, harvey. the prague hotel in the black in less than three years and a successful ipo. who said passion wasn't productive? i don't know anyone that's ever said that. jones, tell me something. hmm? you have hotels in different countries but you spent last week in daniel vega's lisbon resort. well, just, you know, checking out the competition. that was more than a fact finding mission. you're thinking merger. do you honestly believe that i'd do that without talking to you first? i know you would. then, perhaps i did. jones, if you try to pursue a merger, you may not control what happens to your business that you built so passionately. okay, sherlock, hear me out. combined, we're hotels in countries. i like having multiple homes. but you don't need another name on the mortgage. it's a good deal. yeah. and it's my job to get you a better one. okay? promise me you didn't do a handshake deal. donna? who's ready for mock trial ? what, like, make believe trials? are we going to play monopoly after? this is your debutante ball. the impression you make on the partners will last. and let me guess. harvey was. oh, legendary. shocking. sydney thompson was a consultant with lunders global initiative. she had a few too many and decided to entertain her friends with an impersonation of her boss, lena lunders. this impersonation was recorded and uploaded onto a social networking site. the next day, she was fired. sydney is now suing for wrongful termination. can't cheat your way out of this one. the partners have been instructed to only use the associates in emergency situations. let the games begin. all right. when your name is called, please step up and meet your match. i think you mean my bitch, louis. ooh! jean kaplan? i'm glad jessica finally chose a case with a strong female character. last year, i was forced to play a traffic cop. it was a total waste of my talent. wait a minute. you play witnesses? oh, i don't play anything. i embody. and if i'm on your team, you're a winner. well, in that case. no. okay. kyle durant. mike ross. mike ross. kyle for the plaintiff. ross for the defendant. may the best man win. oh, by the way, kyle, weren't you a national mock trial champion? that's right, louis. in high school, college, and law school. see the money, wanna stay for your meal get another piece of pie for your wife everybody wanna know how it feel everybody wanna see what it's like i'll even eat a bean pie i don't mind me and missy is so early busy, busy making money all right! all step back i'm 'bout to dance the greenback boogie i need an assessment of all of vega's hotels. okay? i want you to check annual earnings, property value. you should be writing. yeah, this all doesn't sound like an emergency. the mock trial. okay. i'm on it. uh, listen, harvey, about. i don't give advice. okay. please, sensei? i'm out of my league with this thing. listen to me. don't go to trial. it's a mock trial. i think the trial part is kind of a prerequisite. all right. law is about control, okay? you can only control so much with a jury, judge, witnesses, and another lawyer with an ego complex. what if the lawyer doesn't have an ego complex? every lawyer has an ego complex. the firm has presented an exercise where there's potential for failure. okay? all i'm saying is try and create a situation where that's not even a possibility. kobayashi maru. koba what, now? star trek. captain kirk. he wins a no win situation by rewriting the rules. you're a trekkie. hey. captain kirk is the man, okay? i don't want to hear another word about it. now, enough with your fake law problem. let's deal with my real one. aye aye, captain. you want to know how to do a cross? some people like to use big words. some people like to go for sympathy. but personally, i'm a little more go for the groin. oh, hey, mike. you mind dismissing the peanut gallery so we can talk, kyle? i'm sorry, guys. looks like ross here, came to plead for mercy. if you're here for the witness exhibit exchange, don't bother. i already know who you're going to call and what evidence you're going to use. actually, i'm not going to call any witnesses or present any evidence. let's settle. or i could beat you. the plaintiff has shown a pattern of making derogatory statements about my client. hearsay. not the emails. which have no tone of voice and are subject to interpretation. which is exactly why your argument is shaky at best. then beat me in court. kyle. there is a reason that harvey chose me to be his guy. do you really want to find out what that reason is? and how do i know this isn't some sort of trick? it's not a trick. it's just our chance to stand out. look, settling gets us in and out of there in five minutes. you drop the suit, and you and i spend the rest of the week making ourselves indispensable to the partners while everyone else buries their heads in candy land court. i'm going against my better judgment and trusting you. so, we have a deal? daniel. the paperwork looks good, despite the fact that you two decided to go lawyer commando. but the devil's always in the details. harvey, i know that impulse purchases don't exist in your world, but the timing was right. and as for the details, i like to leave that to my man, scott. does he always like to be late? she. just got off a plane from london. meet ms. dana scott. welcome. hi. thank you. scottie. harvey. oh, you two know each other? we went to harvard law together. harvey was fifth in the class and i was. oh, i forget. what was it? married to the library? that's right. number one. number one at studying. okay. this way. tell me, scottie, what's my success rate against you in the real world where we practice real law? oh, harvey, there should be no winners or losers in a merger. just a happy new couple. that's right. and . well, i say we let these two talk deal points while i try your chef's famous sea bass. absolutely. play nice. we like each other, even if you two don't. married to the library ? it's not my fault the library was the best you could do. do you have the preliminary proposal? no, i just flew in from london completely unprepared. try not to be intimidated. i used some big words. overcompensation isn't that big of a word. it isn't? i can hardly wait to see the work of a senior partner. i see my promotion popped up on your harvey specter google alert. that's not all that's going to pop up. can't remember the last time we had a bed. pretty convenient that we're working on a hotel merger. remember the mining deal? shaft ? how could i forget? listen, about the due diligence. uh uh uh, harvey. you know the rules. no case negotiations until we're done. i think that might be a while. oh. couldn't resist seeing brilliance in action, huh? actually, i have to be here. i'm playing the part of the plaintiff. wow. i knew you were pissed, but i didn't realize you were petty. what does that mean? it's an adjective. it means small minded, spiteful. okay. you chose to work with the one guy who's going against me. kyle asked me and i said yes. you know what? it doesn't really matter. because you're never going to take the stand. really? how's that? it's a surprise. prepare to watch a mock trial legend be born. is counsel ready to proceed with opening statements? we'd like to submit a settlement agreement. plaintiff is ready, your honor. which is it, counselor? um, the counsel for the plaintiff and i agreed to a settlement yesterday. he must have misunderstood. we had discussed, but i never agreed to anything. do you have a signed agreement? uh, i. no. then we are ready to proceed. you have the floor. thank you. on march st, , sydney thompson was unwittingly recorded on a cell phone. she made a joke. the type of joke that i'm sure every person in this courtroom has made at one point or another. and yet, she was fired. she was denied severance. mr. ross. mr. ross. are you ready? um. the, uh. the defense. uh. according to bowmaster v. whitely, if the party to a settlement is surprised by the repudiation of the settlement, then the court must provide a reasonable amount of time to prepare for the trial. reasonable time. yes, your honor. you get five minutes. vega has more property. debeque has more potential. which is harder to monetarily define. this isn't the library, scottie. my guy is an up and comer. that's why your guy is pouncing. your client is an impulse shopper. which is what may have made him a quick success, but could make him an even faster failure. so, he's a passionate guy. he falls in love with a city and he builds himself a hotel. who are you to argue with his track record? i'm a realist. and i have never seen a deal pushed through so quickly. so, what? so, your guy might wake up tomorrow and decide that he doesn't want to do this. which is why i'm not showing you our private books without a signed deal. is that a joke? am i laughing? look, i may not have been awake during our m a clinic. except for when you were copying my notes. which was no walk in the park. you write like a monkey. but in any case, due diligence is a requirement. i have an obligation to my client. then, we don't have a deal. and everyone's going to know it's because you killed it. you know. i don't see you rushing to show us your private books. i have nothing to hide. you can have full access to our books right now. great. you show me yours and i'll show you mine. don't say it, harvey. mike. hey, are you okay? now, you care? mr. ross, i'm going to have to ask you not to speak to my client. she's not your client. she is rachel, the paralegal. and i only have five minutes, so you should really get out of my face. what's your problem, mike? my problem is that you don't have the balls to make this a fair fight, kyle. lawyering isn't about fighting fair. and you better watch your false accusations or i might just sue you for defamation. come on. the defendant wishes to countersue. on what grounds? i believe that's my line, counselor. defamation of character. the plaintiff's video negatively impacted the perception of lena lunders and impaired her financial well being. that's ridiculous, your honor. in order for there to be defamation, the statements made would have had to have been false. that's not the case here. then, you should have no problem proving that in court. the countersuit is allowed. are you serious? would you like to approach the bench and find out how serious i am? your honor, the defense should have filed counterclaims before the trial began. yes. he should have. but no one in this crop of associates had the foresight to do so. and we drafted a whole addendum just because we assumed one of you would. so, i'm going to allow it. do you have a problem with that? no, your honor. this is now a defamation trial. you have until friday to prepare. nice recovery. thinking on your feet. but you wouldn't have had to if you hadn't been so naive. thank you, your honor. how did the negotiation go? you come out on top? why didn't you tell me scottie was opposing counsel? because i didn't want you to have performance anxiety. about the case. she's tough. you're obvious. and your fly is unzipped. no, it isn't. but it was earlier today. you can do better. ooh. is that what scottie said? type up the deal points. i got her to cave. debeque's going to run the show. all i had to do was show her our books. i can't believe it. you gave me, like, the worst advice anyone's ever given another person. take the drama down a notch, juliet. i tried to settle and i got completely blind sided. i told you to settle. i didn't tell you to be stupid. what do you think is going to happen in the real world? you have to be prepared for anything. well, in the real world, i won't have to be looking for someone to play my fake witness in my fake trial. wait, wait, wait, wait. what do you think? you think witnesses are just going to jump up and present themselves? because they're not. and sometimes, when you have one, they disappear or recant. and you know what you do? you deal with it. mock trial is about figuring out what type of lawyer you want to be. and there's only two types. winners and losers. okay. that sounds great, harvey, but i haven't prepared. i don't have anyone to play my client or my witness. and apparently, i'm going up against someone that i can't trust. figure out a way to beat him, anyway. winners don't make excuses when the other side plays the game. hey, donna. i proofed that final agreement on the hotel merger. quick question. has harvey ever heard of spell check? oh, my god. sorry. are you. no, no, no. it's okay. no, no. you don't have to cry. it's okay. it's okay. he says things sometimes, and they. and they cut to the bone. he does it to me, too. i know. he says the. it's not bad, right? i can also do the demi moore single tear, left eye or right eye, if that's better for the character. okay, i'm scared. what's going on? if i'm going to play lena lunders for you. i need to be able to use my full range of emotions. oh, my god. i love you. yeah, i know. focus. you need another witness. and at this point, everybody else in the firm is booked up. aw! is mommy helping you clean up your mess, ross? am i mommy in this scenario? what? uh. ross is just. a baby. oh, my god. i cannot believe i'm going to lose to that tool. okay. come on. no pity parties. go to an outside source for the other witness. for the best friend, you need somebody pretty, sympathetic, and most importantly, willing to go above and beyond for you. what are you doing here? jenny, come on. i need your help. i've got nowhere else to go. you yelled at me. kissed me. pushed me away. disappeared. i haven't talked to you in forever. i don't even know what's going on in your life. well, if you let me in, i'll explain. and i promise it's a really good story. so, you've been living a lie this whole time. yeah. that's awesome. really? yeah. i mean, as far as double lives go, you're maybe not as cool as clark kent. still. clark kent. mmm hmm. okay. you're cut off. mmm. what? nothing. it just feels really good to tell you. i don't really have anybody i can talk to about it. you trust me. yeah. i guess i do. i like that. ooh, i really like this. hmm. i've got to hand it to you, harvey. you may not be able to commit to a woman, but you have been in this place a very long time. she gets me. and has no needs. i don't think you understand how high maintenance this place is. he agreed to all your terms despite my protests that he could do better. so, we're done. minus a few signatures. that's not done. want me to leave? ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please note. can i ask a question? no, you can't ask questions as a witness. don't ask questions. ladies and gentlemen. yeah, i know that. but, um. what are you doing? what do you mean? you're walking around like you have a giant stick up your ass. it's a trial, jenny. i. i have to be powerful. but that's not you. thanks. no. you are charming and funny and trustworthy. that's your power. and that's great when i'm trying to con my way into the lsats, but this is a courtroom. it's useless there. but it's still you. so? take a deep breath. just talk to me. ask me where do i work. where do you work? lunders global initiative. ask me how i know sydney. how do you know sydney? she was my friend. and i've missed her every day that she's been gone. and why aren't you friends anymore? i don't know. if you do it like that they'll fall in love with you. scottie, that was amazing. careful, harvey. you need to hydrate. you just ran a marathon. and i think you just beat me. uh oh. that's a lawyer look. law school. post mock trial in the library. second circuit court of appeals. class action on the prep room table. dempsey settlement. in my office, on the desk and under. so, what, are we doing a highlight reel? as a matter of fact, we are. those were top moments, right? they weren't bad. no, they were great. and i just realized this was better. you were the best you've ever been and i know why. why? you hid something from me in the negotiation. and i want to know what. you know what? you are ridiculous. uh, you know what? don't do that. okay? do what? you think i don't know victory sex when i see it? huh? see it? what is it? one of vega's properties is bankrupt? the buenos aires one? what, uh. what do you want me to say, harvey? you. yes. you got me. i screwed you. how? oh, my god. you want an anatomy lesson now? that's my shirt. consider it a winner's reward. hey, harvey. you were right. there's been a steady stream of stock buying by vega's company in the last hours. it's a hostile takeover. yeah. but why are they disguising it as a merger? they wanted access to our private books. she tricked me. what? she pretended she didn't want to hand over their books so i wouldn't notice when she asked for ours. it's a classic maneuver. she made me think it was my idea. how do you know that? because i taught her how to do it. so, now, they see how strong debeque's company is and they want to buy it. and they'll be running it by the time scottie's back in london. wow. i leave you alone for two days. this is my mistake. this is halley's comet. take a good look. because it won't happen again. so, what are you going to do? i want to know which of debeque's hotels are the most valuable. and how fast we can get them on the market. wait. you want debeque to sell his best hotels? it's called the crown jewel defense. we unload the highest grossing assets and we make ourselves look undesirable. debeque will never agree to that. trust me, debeque has enough passion for his company that he'll be willing to chop off an arm to save the body. okay. you know you had that memorized the first time you read it, right? yeah, but i didn't finish reading it because a certain witness chose to be distracting. that must have been rough for you. yeah. you have no idea. where can i get some water? i need to make sure my voice holds up. right there. i'll make you a deal. winner gets the girl. you know, i'm never going to make another deal with you again. hey. they remind me of a younger, less attractive you and me. please don't say things like that. and i know that you rigged the lottery so that mike would get kyle. please. rigged, expedited. they're all just words. besides, don't you want to see what your boy is made of? you talking bet? yeah. usual amount. i believe we have a wager. some of us shower before we go to work. mr. specter. you know what? save it. right. how are you feeling? good. good? yeah. good. is it inappropriate to take a xanax if you're a witness in a trial? i've seen clients do much worse. actually, i'm not a client. i'm a witness in a friend's mock trial. one thing. if you get into trouble, don't play the case. play the man. what are you talking about? good lawyers worry about facts. great lawyers worry about their opponents. kyle is cocky and devious. figure out a way to use that against him. okay. anything else? kick his ass. who's your friend? uh, mike ross. do you know him? uh, yeah. uh, it's a big firm. but i know who he is. yeah. god, i don't know why i'm so nervous. i just know this is a big deal to him and i don't want to let him down. hmm. sydney thompson was at a party and made a joke. it wasn't meant to be mean or to be taken as fact. and it most certainly was never meant to be public. the defense will show. that sydney thompson chose to publicly defame her boss with an impression that she knew would be damaging both to lena lunders' reputation and her company. i call lena lunders to the stand. uh. do you need a minute? no. i can continue. thank you. please. i'm a self made woman. i created the global initiative to target problems in third world countries. i take my work very seriously. and if a joke can be made of that, fine. but as a woman in power, people look at your success and label you. they don't know the complexity it takes for a woman to succeed in this business. and when someone undermines that. well. we have to fight for ourselves. don't we, your honor? objection. so, it's hard to be a woman in business? that has nothing to do with the facts of this case. we can only understand the damage your client has done by fully understanding the care with which ms. lunders has built her reputation. um. i'm sorry. can you ask me the question one more time? take a deep breath. it's just you and me. we're just going to have a conversation about your job, okay? yeah. okay. how do you know the defendant, sydney thompson? we were coworkers. we started at the same level. and then, i was promoted to be her immediate superior. and do you know about the video in question? yes, i was at the party that night. and what were you celebrating that night? my promotion. same night? that's interesting. ms. ginnesse, what did you think of the impersonation? it was too far. it was mean. so, why do you think ms. thompson did it? ms. lunders promoted me. sydney hated it. and that's why she made the video. well, thank you, ms. ginnesse. nothing further, your honor. did sydney ever tell you that she hated your promotion? not exactly. yes or no, please. no. well, then, how do you know that she hated your promotion? i could just tell. can you tell what i'm thinking right now? that you're wishing i would agree with everything you say? no. i was thinking that if you could actually read my mind, i wouldn't bother asking you questions. but you can't read my mind, can you? no, i'm a managing director. not a magician. no. and i'm pretty sure you can't read sydney's, either. and you actually have no idea why she made that video. correct? i guess i don't. no. good afternoon, ms. scott. thank you. are you here to give me a proper send off? i don't think we can do that out here on the street. you sure? you tricked me. i'm impressed. to be fair, vega did want a merger. i just convinced him that given your client's propensity for rash purchases, that allowing him to stay in charge was a bad idea. vega needed debeque's hotels minus debeque. and i found a way. one that he never asked for or wanted. and one that he's never going to get. is. is this for real? three of debeque's properties that will be on the market by the end of day. he's never going to let you sell off his crown jewels. see, that's the thing about passionate clients. when they're crossed, they get angry. and they'll do anything to get back. don't do this, harvey. look. there's another way we can do this. we can get our clients into a room together, you can tell them you were wrong, and we can convince them back into a merger. ms. thompson, what was the intent behind your impersonation? i was just trying to be funny. everyone in our office makes jokes. as a matter of fact, ms. lunders encourages us to be informal. i can't win this just on the facts. but i expected it. i think everyone has the impulse to move up and at a certain point, you just have to let it go. so, that's what i did. what are you going to do? i'm going to play the woman, not the case. you say you expected to be passed over for a promotion, correct? yes. and yet, you applied three times. yes. and you were never promoted. as i said. yes. when nora ginnesse was promoted, you wrote scathing emails to the rest of your coworkers in response. not scathing. the intent was to be funny. oh, right. you like to be funny. who doesn't like to laugh? someone whose reputation has been ruined. objection. just a thought. he's testifying. sustained. mr. ross, questions. i'm sorry, your honor. forgive me. i was just trying to be funny. on your performance review, lena lunders wrote, good work ethic, lacks skills. do you think that's a fair assessment? fair? i. i don't know. your coworkers were promoted and your boss was calling you mediocre. are you mediocre? no. so, why haven't you been promoted? i don't know. do you think you deserve better? doesn't everyone? so, why haven't you tried? i have tried. why haven't you improved? i didn't say i haven't improved. well, your review did. your five years without a promotion did. look. you were so angry that you weren't moving forward that you lashed out at your boss. objection. testifying. no. and everyone was moving past you. so, what? people making good on their potential. badgering, your honor. people who can cut it. i can cut it! excuse me, your honor. settlement's still on the table. what? let's settle. same deal. win win. no, i'm good. excuse me? i've seen the dreamy looks, ross. you like her. so, you're offering me a settlement because you don't want to hurt her feelings. but i'd rather see if you'll break her. giddy up, cowboy. counselor. would you like to proceed? no, your honor. are you sure? yes, your honor. nothing further. well, normally, we'd move on to closing statements. but it's been a long week. and honestly, we all know where this is going. so, the court rules in favor of the defendant. court is adjourned. mr. ross. naive and soft. not qualities we're looking for at pearson hardman. gentlemen, i appreciate you leaving the swords at home. what started off as a true merger never needed to become anything different. daniel, i want you to listen to me. i know harvey, and he just wants to merge your businesses so he can double his billable hours. quiet, scott. i want to hear what he has to say. i'm just here to get my client the deal that he wants. and what he wants is a merger. is that right, jones? that's right. daniel. your law firm overreached in a situation where it wasn't necessary. it's not entirely scottie's fault. we lawyers all have an instinct to win. but sometimes, we may not fully understand what that means. we understand what it means. well, maybe you do and maybe you don't. for me, it would be to see both men return to the initial deal, so that you can grow both your businesses. instead of having one company with a hostile reputation and the other a shell of what it once was. i mean, that doesn't sound like a win to me. i'm sorry. let's just go back to the original deal. we can run it together. you need anything? because otherwise, i'm going to head out. celebratory drinks with the associates? yep. and what exactly are you celebrating? you know what? you can save the disappointment, harvey. i know what i did. do you? because what i saw is that you backed off because you were worried about hurting your girlfriend's feelings. it was a fake trial. all right? i weighed the pros and the cons and i decided it wasn't worth hurting someone for the result. the result is you just told every partner in this firm, including myself, that you have a weak stomach. you don't have what it takes. you know, you keep telling me that i have to decide what kind of lawyer i want to be. and if i were smart, i'd probably be just like you. because everybody knows you're the best. but i'm also trying to decide what kind of person i want to be. and sometimes, i like my kind of person a lot more than yours. you want to know what kind of person i am? tough, but fair. i call it like i see it. and what i see is a kid who asked for an opportunity and still hasn't decided if he wants it or not. single malt, please. harvard club? i thought you hate this place. vega kicked me out of his hotel. so, you know, beggars. save the pout. you were head of law review. you clerked for a supreme court judge. and you almost beat me. i think that deserves a drink. on you. i'd laugh, but i just got fired. from the firm? no. but the firm is not going to be happy. that's why i'm not already on a plane. hey, the scottie i know is tougher than that. is she? whoa. you want to go back to our alma mater and see a lecture on why women are better at science? might cheer you up. maybe. but i'm not going with you. come on. we're still friends. i'm getting married, harvey. his name is steve. and, uh, he asked me a month ago. and, um, when i get back to london, i'm. i'm going to say yes. what would you like me to say? nothing. come here. i'm sorry i won. no, harvey. i would hate it if you were sorry about that. you didn't have to do that, you know. i know. i could have handled it. i know. that was a thank you, if you couldn't tell. i could tell. so, um, jenny was a great witness. really likable and pretty. yeah. yeah, she is. i know i was hard on you this week. it's okay, rachel. no, it. did you ever take a minute to wonder why i was so mad at you? i just expect more from you than most people. why? you're a smart guy. you can figure it out
