what do you want a book for? to read. to read? why would you wanna read when you got the television set sitting right in front of you? there's nothing you can get from a book that you can't get from a television faster. get out of the way! narrator matilda already knew that she was somewhat different from her family. she saw that whatever she needed in this world, she'd have to get herself. bye. ciao. there's fish fingers in the microwave. narrator the next morning, after her parents left, matilda set off in search of a book. where are the children's books, please? in that room right over there. would you like me to pick you out one with lots of pictures in it? no, thank you. i'm sure i can manage. narrator from then on, every day, as soon as her mother went to bingo, matilda walked the blocks to the library and devoured one book after another. when she finished all the children's books, she started wandering around in search of something else. mrs. phelps, who had been watching her with fascination for the past few weeks, offered matilda some valuable library information. you know, you could have your very own library card. and then you could take books home and you wouldn't have to walk here every day. you could take as many as you like. that would be wonderful. narrator so matilda's strong, young mind continued to grow, nurtured by the voices of all those authors who had sent their books out into the world like ships onto the sea. these books gave matilda a hopeful and comforting message you are not alone. any packages come today? mm mm. where did all this come from? the library. the library? you've never set foot in a library. you're only years old. six and a half. you're . six and a half. if you were and a half, you'd be in school already. i want to be in school. i told you i was supposed to start school in september. you wouldn't listen. get up. get up! get out here. give me that book. dearest pie, how old is matilda?

for being a smart aleck. when a person is bad, that person has to be taught a lesson. person? get up! get up. narrator harry wormwood had unintentionally given his daughter the first practical advice she could use. he meant to say, when a child is bad. instead he said, when a person is bad. and thereby introduced a revolutionary idea that children could punish their parents. only when they deserved it, of course. harry coughing and grunting harry michael, come into my room. what?
