 you're starting to look old. my dad's been saying that to me since i was fifteen. because nice greek girls are supposed to do three things in life marry greek boys, make greek babies and feed everyone. until the day we die. when i was growing up, i knew i was different. the other girls were blond and delicate. and i was a swarthy year old with sideburns. i so badly wanted to be like the popular girls. all sitting together, talking. eating their wonderbread sandwiches. what's that? it's ''moussaka''. ''moose caca''? the pretty girls went to brownie's. i had to go to greek school. at greek school, i learned valuable lessons like ''if nick has one goat, and maria has nine, how soon will they marry? my mom was always cooking foods filled with warmth and wisdom. and never forgetting that side dish of steaming hot guilt. niko, don't play with the food! at your age, we didn't have food. ma? what? why do i have to go to greek school? when you get married, don't you want to write your mother in law? niko, come on, eat! we lived in a normal middle class chicago neighborhood. of tasteful modest homes. our house, however, was modeled after the parthenon. complete with corinthian columns and guarded by statues of the gods. in case the neighbors had any doubts about our heritage. they could just check out our subtle tribute to the greek flag. my dad believed in only two things that greeks should educate non greeks about being greek. and that any illment, from psoriasis to poison ivy. could be cured with windex. six years later i was , athena, my older perfect sister, was . and my brother nick was . every morning, my dad would lecture us. on the history of our people, the great civilization the greeks. now, name three things the greeks did first. astronomy, philosophy and democracy. bravo! very good. now, give me a word. any word, and i'll show you how the root of that word is greek. okay? how about arachnophobia? ''arachna'', that comes from the greek word for ''spider''. and ''phobia'' means ''fear'', so fear of spider. there you go. okay, mr. portokalos. how about the word ''kimono''? kimono? kimono, kimono. of course! ''kimono'' comes from the greek word ''cheimonas''. that means ''winter''. so, what do you wear in the winter time to stay warm? a robe. you see? robe, kimono. there you go. bye bye. good bye, mr. portokalos. toula! you should be proud to be greek. years went by, and dad brought his mother from greece to live with us. because we weren't weird enough. listen up, ugly turk. you're not kidnapping me. get her! where is she going? mama, please. the greeks and the turks are friends now! we told my grandma that war was over, but she still slept with a knife. mama! stop hitting me! niko, be careful! she has a very mean punch! mama! please, come back! nice greek girls who don't find a husband work in the family restaurant. so, here i am, day after day, year after year. thirty, and way passed my expiration date. it's freezing! fortoula! you closed last night, you're opening this morning. i have no life. ah, toula, you talk to me sometime, uh? ma, you're going to make me swallow my tongue. toula! ls nikki here? what's up there? no, my nikki. she was supposed to come over to curl my hair. nick, did you check the meat before you signed for it? dad checked it. it'd better be fresh. my brother has jobs to cook and to marry a greek virgin. voula, have something to eat before you go to work. if nagging was an olympic sport, my aunt voula would have a gold medal. taki. you couldn't wait for me? sorry. sorry.

it's lucky for me l have you to tie my shoes! maria. excuse me, is this seat taken? what are you two talking about? about my butt. i don't like it, but taki likes it. listen, i'm not going to pretend. this is something i've always wanted to do. i'm just saying it's different. i've been learning about computers. there's this course. it's a seminar all about computers and tourism. with all the latest applications and programs. i could apply it here. your business would double, triple. you could be with ''theo'' more. you could take a vacation. i could book it for you. would you hire me? of course. oh, my god! okay! okay! i'm sorry. oh, my god, ma! we must let costa think this was his idea. that he came up with it. ma, he's going to figure it out. don't you worry. i know what to do. no, you talk, talk, talk. do you want my help? yes, i want your help. but don't tell me what to say. perfect. so, voula, how is business? oh, war to me! business is bad. what's the matter? what happened? you need money? no, no. what she means is that, with two businesses, she suffers. she suffers? she is at the travel agency alone. because everybody else is working at the big dry cleaning store. that's right. i make taki go to the dry cleaners store. and now i have no time with him. so send angelo or nikki to the travel agency. and you'll be with taki at the dry cleaner. that would be good. that would be no good. no good? no good, no good. because neither angelo or nikki know how to use the computer. that's why that won't work. computer? i have your answer! toula will go to the travel agency, and nikki comes here to work for us. i can't believe that. wonderful. wonderful! you see?

''miller'' comes from the greek word ''milo''. which means ''apple'', so there you go. as many of you know, our name, portokalos. comes from the greek word ''portokali'', which means ''orange''. okay, here tonight we have. apple and orange. we're all different. but, in the end, we're all fruit. yes, we're all fruit. my wife and me, we have a gift. see, that's what we do. the parents, they give a gift. here. oh, my god. they bought us a house. thank you. i don't believe that. a house! ''thea'' voula, we're going to dance. i know, dear. let me get taki. athena, i'm going to be a painter! good! you can start with our fence. this is just a really nice wedding. that's good. we're going to dance now. come on! oh, no. i think i need some more of those before i do that. what do you say? bottoms up! all right. let's go, ''harry''. come on, costa! oh, taki. he looks greek. that's it. like this. everybody dance. everybody dance, dance. sometimes, i'm afraid that it didn't happen. i'm scared i'll wake up and still be buttering garlic bread. waiting for my life to start. but it did happen. it did! and i figured out some stuff. my family is big and loud, but they're my family. we fight, we laugh and, yes, we roast lamb in the front yard. and wherever i go, whatever i do, they will always be there. so, ian and i moved into the house my parents bought us. a minute later, i was pregnant, and years later. it was our daughter's turn to go to greek school. but mom, i want to go to brownie's! i know, i know. but i promise you this you can marry anybody you want. thanks, baby. greek school, ''pomi''! what does that mean?
