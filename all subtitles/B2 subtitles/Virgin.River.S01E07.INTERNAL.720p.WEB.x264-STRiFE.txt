i don't know. maybe. it's like we talk about the kids, and we talk about broken sprinkler heads, and we talk about his work. but we're just not connected like we used to be, and. i don't know if we'll ever get that back. look, i know bill loves you. sometimes love isn't enough. what can i do to help you? oh. nothing. because i'm the only one who can decide how hard i wanna fight for my marriage. okay, well. why don't i come to la? then i can help with the kids. it'll give you and bill a chance to figure things out. okay?

i didn't see doc come by today. uh, impromptu fishing trip. i don't know why he goes. he never catches anything bigger than a goldfish. he probably enjoys the solitude. oh, not that he prefers being alone to your company. that's not what i meant. you know, i don't really know him. good lord, you can a dig a hole faster than a gopher in springtime. morning, ladies. did i see doc heading out of town? fishing. you know, i saw him dancing mighty close to muriel st. claire at the mingle. which was lovely, by the way. yeah. the mingle was beautiful. thanks. joy said she saw them dancing cheek to cheek. dollars to doughnuts, that woman has her sights set on becoming the next mrs. mullins. oh, speaking of doughnuts, could i have a dozen, please? assorted. you pick. that's an awful lot of doughnuts. well, um. we have a full house to feed. well, folks who were in town for the mingle have already cleared out. i thought mel was your only guest at the moment. and her sister. i saw joey leave this morning. if you don't need them, i can put them back in the case. no, no, no. i mean. they're already packed up. you know, i. i think it's getting late. i'd better be running along. thank you. what about your change?

yeah. yeah, sure thing. thanks. hey, what's goin' on with you? you barely said anything since we left the bar. i hate to admit it, but you might have been right. okay. you're gonna have to be a little more specific. about charmaine. what happened? i'm sorry. you don't have to tell me. it's. it's really none of my business. she said she wants a commitment. what did you tell her? i didn't know what to say. how did she take that? she won't return my calls. you know, at some point, you're gonna have to tell her how you really feel. i just don't wanna hurt her. did you ever think that you're the one that doesn't wanna get hurt? we're here. well timed, mr. sheridan. well timed. we really need to get in there. yeah, copy that. come on. lydie! lydie, can you hear me? there's no reception here. yeah, i see that. what are you supposed to do if there's an emergency? improvise. lydie, can you hear me? oh, hey, ricky. ricky. lydie. lydie. hey. hey. hey, lydie. it's mel. i work with doc. i'm a nurse practitioner. can you hear me? oh. hey, there. hey, lydie. it's okay. i'm here too. jack. yeah. jack. what?

it's sugar water. oh, okay. it should help stabilize your blood sugar levels. ricky told me that you're a diabetic. where's ricky? well, he. he's at the bar. we told him we'd take care of you. it's okay. okay. you didn't have to come all the way out here, you know. we wanted to come. i wanted to make sure you're okay. i'm fine. i'm just a little light headed, is all. yeah. um, how about we get you to the bed? here, let me take that. wait a second. all right. okay. ready? can you stand up? yeah, yes. yeah. one, two. three. there you go. easy. okay. i'm good. i'm good. okay, okay. all right. take a seat. mmph. you're okay. okay. thank you. you're welcome. tell you what. you know what? i'm gonna go outside and take a look at your gate, and i'll leave you two ladies to talk, yeah? okay. sure. i. i guess that would be all right. you're in good hands. lydie, did you test your blood today? i can't stand it. it makes me feel like a pin cushion. have you been taking your medications? i hate those shots. well, i think your blood sugar level dipped, which is why you blacked out. did ricky put you up to this? he's always worrying about me, you know. lydie, it's really important for you to check your blood sugar and to take your insulin on a regular basis. where's your blood sugar monitor? ah, it's over there by. by the bed. okay. i didn't mean for ricky to bother anybody. it's not a bother. he just wants to make sure you're taking care of yourself. you know, you look a little like my daughter, elaine, ricky's mother. you know, she wanted to be a nurse. then she met ricky's father, and. i always knew he was trouble from the moment i laid eyes on him. when ricky was born, he stuck around for a few months, and then. up and left. elaine was devastated. they said that it was the drugs that killed her. but i know that. my baby died from a broken heart. and then. ricky came to live with me, and it's been the two of us ever since. well, it sounds like you two are lucky to have each other. he's all i have left. okay, the gate's all fixed. oh, thank you, jack. all right, unfortunately, it's pin cushion time. oh. i'm sorry. are you ready? i think so. okay, one, two, three. sorry. uh, you know, my husband, herb, he was the exact opposite of ricky's dad. he was strong and dependable. not a day goes by i don't miss him. it's been ten years since he's been gone, and. and it feels like yesterday. did herb help you manage your diabetes? oh, he was insufferable. he, uh. kept pestering me to move around. stop eating this or that. okay, well, lydie, your blood sugar level is still really low. so, i'd like to get you checked out at the hospital. jack can call ricky, and i'll call grace valley and let them know that we're coming. i don't wanna go to the hospital. i know, but you need to be monitored. hey, lydie, you know. would it make you feel better if i had ricky come meet us there? do you think going to the hospital is necessary? well, i think that herb would want you to take care of yourself, and i know that it will make ricky feel better too. he's the only reason i keep going. i miss my herb so much. yeah. it's okay. i'm sorry. it's okay. i'm sorry. it's okay. it's okay. thank you. thank you. anybody else? oh, yes, i'd love a top up. here. thank you, muriel. oh, you're welcome. uh oh. well. lucky for you all, i'm in the mood for a doughnut. hm. lilly. you're looking well. thank you. i'm feeling a little better every day. glad to hear it. baby chloe needs her mama. and you know what i need? something glazed. ooh! it's been months since we gals have gotten together. oh. don't just sit there. deal me in. oh, um. sorry, honey. uh, we've already got a full house. i saw an empty chair. what are we playing? canasta. i prefer seven card stud, but canasta it is. hope, the truth is, we. well? spit it out. we don't wanna play with you. you don't want me to play cards with you? no. well, isn't that something? you're very. competitive. hm. so, you don't care about winning? because last time we played, you cleaned house. it's nothing personal. no. we're just looking to have a friendly game. i always maintain strict decorum during leisure activities. honey, you're like a tornado in a glass factory. and your outbursts are very upsetting. you've always been too sensitive. do you think i'm too sensitive? fine. i. i won't yell. and you promise not to badger me if i keep winning? consider this a badger free zone. come on, ladies. let's give her a chance. finally! you were always my favorite. hey, shift's not over for another hour. i'm gonna bounce. i'm not feelin' so good. did you clean out the grease trap? yeah. that's probably what made me feel sick. thing's disgusting. yeah, well, you look like you might be more hung over than sick. i don't remember asking you. why are you really here, brady? work, just like you. oh, no. no, you and i, we are. we are nothin' alike. man, you're never gonna change, are you? still think we're back in mosul. hoo rah! i'm tryin', preach. just give me a break, all right? hey. you stole money out of the safe. you steal tips from the wait staff. i think i've cut you enough breaks. you know, you're lucky this is jack's place. anybody else would have kicked your ass to the curb. that's what it is, isn't it? you can't handle that jack and i are tight. huh! you're not a friend. you're a leech. and for once, why can't you just do the right thing, man? and what's that, preach? leave town. you know, just get out of here. go. i'm gone. hey, preacher. hey. little man. hi. hello. our car died. oh. yeah. um, i parked it out back to make a delivery across the street. when i got back, the car wouldn't start. i left the door open, drained the battery. do you think you could give us a jump? oh, you know what? never mind. you're busy. no, no, it's okay. uh, why don't you two grab a seat? hm? get something warm to drink. how about some hot cocoa? extra marshmallows? as many as you can handle. thank you, preacher. okay. well, they're gonna keep lydie overnight, but ricky's gonna stay with her. good. yeah. i'll come back and check on them tomorrow. okay. sounds good. you ready? mel? mel. what don't you understand? i need to be in that room! i'm sorry, but you're not allowed. i'm gonna be doing his follow up care, okay? i'm. i'm sorry. i know you're just doing your job. but what would you do if you were me? that's my husband. mel. what? are you ready? ready. to go back home. i'm sorry. i. i have to sit down. let me get you a water. you feeling any better? you wanna talk about it? i can't. it's okay. hey, it's okay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. no, it's okay. hey, it's okay. ah, okay. ahem. i'm gonna take, uh. god, i can't give her that. oh. canasta. i'm out. you have got to be kidding me. now, hope. don't you now hope me. that's three hands in a row we were up, and you came back to beat us. that's just the way the game goes. if you're cheating! don't be ridiculous. lilly knew you were collecting kings, and she served one up on a silver platter. coincidence? i think not. i. i. i was holding onto fours. well, i. i demand a rematch. this is exactly why we didn't invite you. i guess i'll save you the trouble of asking me to leave. ladies. enjoy your afternoon. hope. we. lydie said her husband's been dead for ten years. she still misses him every day. well, there's something beautiful about that. or very, very sad. well, maybe a bit of both. my dad used to say that the. price of love was loss. there's probably some truth to that, but i'd say most people. would also say that love is worth the risk, don't you think? honestly, i. i don't. i don't know anymore. how about a little detour? well, as long as it doesn't involve hiking or baseball. hah! okay. i had marshmallows. wow. that is a new jack's bar record, hm? i, uh. i left the car running. you'll need to drive it around for, you know, minutes or so to charge the battery. oh, okay. thank you. you're a lifesaver. so, you goin' on a trip? nope. i mean, i could use a vacation. why do you ask? oh, it's just, i, uh. you know, saw luggage in the back. oh. no, no, i'm just, um. donating some old clothes, and it's easier to get it to the goodwill in clear river. uh huh. mm. mom. okay, okay. come on. okay, uh, you guys should get goin'. yeah. uh. thank you. i owe you. holy cow. what are you, a pinball wizard? yeah, well, i, uh. i used to hang out at this bar when i was in college, and they had a machine just like this. i wasted a lot of time there. well, i wouldn't say wasted. if the whole nursing thing doesn't work out, you could always play professionally. no, that's not a thing. oh, it's not a thing? it's not a thing. really? no. okay. uh. let's see. the. purpose of the papa circuit is to raise awareness of competitive pinball. oh, i'm sorry. did i just. oh, come on. was that distracting? you made me lose my concentration. that's not fair. oh, come on. don't hate the player. oh, i think this game is rigged. uh. okay, what?
