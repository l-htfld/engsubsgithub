miles per hour! the temporal displacement occurred exactly a.m. and zero seconds! jesus christ! jesus christ, doc! youdisintegrated einstein! calm down, marty. i didn'tdisintegrate anything. the molecular structure of both einsteinand the car are completely intact. then where the hell are they? the appropriate question is, when the hell are they? you see, einstein has just becomethe world's first time traveler. i sent him into the future. one minute into the future, to be exact. at precisely a.m. and zero seconds, we shall catch up withhim and the time machine. wait a minute. wait a minute, doc. are you telling me thatyou built a time machine out of a delorean? the way i see it, if you're going to builda time machine into a car, why not do it with some style? besides, the stainless steelconstruction made the flux dispersal. look out! what? is it hot? it's cold. damn cold. einstein, you little devil! einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking! he's all right. he's fine. and he's completely unawarethat anything happened. as far as he's concerned,the trip was instantaneous. that's why his watch isexactly one minute behind mine. he skipped over that minute to instantly arriveat this moment in time. come here. i'll show you how it works. all right. first, you turn the time circuits on. this readout tellsyou where you're going. this one tells you where you are. this one tells you where you were. you input your destinationtime on this keypad. say you want to see the signing of the declaration of independence. or witness the birth of christ. here's a red letter datein the history of science. november th, . yes, of course. november th, . what? i don't get it. what happened? that was the day i invented timetravel. i remember it vividly. i was standing on the edgeof my toilet, hanging a clock. the porcelain was wet. i slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink, and when i came to, i had a revelation, a vision, a picture in myhead, a picture of this. this is what makes time travelpossible. the flux capacitor. flux capacitor? it's taken me almost yearsand my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day. my god, has it been that long? things have certainlychanged around here. i remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. old man peabody owned all of this. he had this crazy ideaabout breeding pine trees. this is heavy duty, doc. this is great. does it run on regularunleaded gasoline? unfortunately, no. it requires something with a little more kick. plutonium. plutonium. wait a minute. are you telling me thatthis sucker is nuclear? hey, hey, hey! keeprolling. keep rolling there. no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but i need a nuclear reaction to generate the . gigawattsof electricity i need. doc, you don't just walk intoa store and buy plutonium. did you rip that off? of course. from a groupof libyan nationalists. they wanted me to build them a bomb, so i took their plutonium and, inturn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts. come on. let's get youa radiation suit. jesus! we must prepare to reload. it's safe now. everything's lead lined. don't you lose those tapes now. i need that as a record. let's put this back here. there we go. i almost forgot my luggage. who knows if they've gotcotton underwear in the future? i'm allergic to all synthetics. the future? that's where you're going? that's right, years into the future. i've always dreamed of seeing thefuture, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. why not? i'll also be able to see whowins the next world series. doc. huh? look me up when you get there. indeed, i will. roll 'em. i, dr. emmett brown, am about to embark onan historic journey. what am i thinking of? i almost forgot tobring extra plutonium. how did i ever expect to getback? one pellet, one trip. i must be out of my mind. what is it, einie? oh, my god. they found me. i don'tknow how, but they found me. run for it, marty! who? who? who do you think? the libyans! holy shit! i'll draw their fire! doc, wait! no! you bastard! go! damn soviet gun. go! come on! move, damn it! jesus! holy shit! let's see if you bastards can do . what is it?

this is a radiation suit. radiation suit? of course. 'cause of all thefallout from the atomic wars. this is truly amazing. a portable television studio. no wonder your presidenthas to be an actor. he's gotta look good on television. whoa. this is it. this isthe part coming up, doc. no, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but i need a nuclear reaction to generate the . gigawatts. what did i just say? this sucker's electrical, but i need a nuclear reaction to generate the . gigawatts. . gigawatts! . gigawatts. great scott! what the hell is a gigawatt? how could i have been socareless? . gigawatts! tom, how am i going togenerate that kind of power? it can't be done, can it? doc, look. all we needis a little plutonium. i'm sure that in , plutonium is availablein every corner drugstore, but in , it's alittle hard to come by. marty, i'm sorry, but i'mafraid you're stuck here. whoa, whoa. doc, stuck here? i can't bestuck here. i got a life in . i got a girl. is she pretty? doc, she's beautiful.she's crazy about me. look at this. look what she wrotehere, doc. i mean, that says it all. doc, you're my only hope. marty, i'm sorry, but the onlypower source capable of generating . gigawatts of electricityis a bolt of lightning. what did you say? a bolt of lightning. unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever going to strike. we do now. this is it! this is the answer. it says here that a bolt of lightning is going to strike the clock tower at precisely p.m.next saturday night! if we could somehowharness this lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. next saturday night, we'resending you back to the future! okay, all right. saturday'sgood. saturday's good. i can spend a week in . i can hang out. you can show me around. marty, that is completelyout of the question. you must not leave this house. you must not see anybodyor talk to anybody. anything you do can have seriousrepercussions on future events. do you understand? yeah. sure. okay. marty, have you interacted withanybody else today, besides me? yeah, well, i might've sortof bumped into my parents. great scott! let me see that photographagain of your brother. just as i thought. this provesmy theory. look at your brother. his head's gone.it's like it's been erased. erased from existence. whoa. they really cleaned thisplace up. looks brand new. now remember. according to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. if they don't meet,they won't fall in love, they won't get marriedand they won't have kids. that's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. your sister will follow, andunless you repair the damage, you'll be next. sounds pretty heavy.weight has nothing to do with it. which one's your pop? that's him. okay. okay, you guys. very funny. you guysare being real mature. maybe you were adopted. okay, real mature, guys. okay, pick up my books. mcfly. that's strickland. jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? shape up, man. you're a slacker. do you want to be a slackerfor the rest of your life? no. what did your motherever see in that kid? i don't know, doc. i guess she felt sorry for him 'cause her dad hit him with the car. hit me with the car. that's the florence nightingale effect. it happens in hospitals when nursesfall in love with their patients. go to it, kid. hey, george, buddy. i have been looking all over for you. you remember me, the guy whosaved your life the other day? oh. yeah. good. there's somebody i'd like you to meet. lorraine? calvin! i'd like you to meet mygood friend george mcfly. hi. it's really a pleasure to meet you. how's your head? good. fine. oh. i've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. are you okay? yeah. i'm sorry. i have to go. come on! isn't he a dreamboat? doc, she didn't even look at him. this is more serious than i thought. apparently, your mother isamorously infatuated with you, instead of your father. whoa. wait a minute, doc. are you trying to tell me thatmy mother has got the hots for me? precisely. whoa. this is heavy. there's that word again. heavy. why are things so heavy in the future? is there a problem with theearth's gravitational pull? what? the only way we're going to get thosetwo to successfully mate is if they're alone together, so you've got to get yourfather and mother to interact in some sort of social. what? you mean like a date? right! what kind of date? i don't know. what do kids do in the ' s? they're your parents.you must know them. what are their common interests? what do they like to do together? nothing. look! there's a rhythmicceremonial ritual coming up. of course! the enchantmentunder the sea dance! they're supposed to go to this. that's where they kissfor the first time. all right, kid. you stick to your father like glue and make sure he takesher to that dance. george, buddy. remember that girl iintroduced you to, lorraine? what are you writing? uh. stories. science fiction stories about visitors coming down to earth from other planets. get out of town! i didn'tknow you did anything creative. let me read some. oh. no, no, no, no. i never let anybody read my stories. why not? well, what if they didn't like them? what if they told me i was no good? i guess that would be prettyhard for somebody to understand. no. no, not hard at all. so, anyway, george. about lorraine. she really likes you. she told me to tell youthat she wants you to ask her to the enchantment under the sea dance. really?
