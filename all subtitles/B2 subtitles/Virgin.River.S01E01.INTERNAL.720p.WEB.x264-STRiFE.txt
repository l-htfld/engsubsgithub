um. could you drop me at the mccrea cabin? it's in virgin river. i've got the address here. anyone who lives within miles of here knows the mccrea cabin. oh. well, from the photo, it's beautiful. um. here. folks around here, we don't pay each other to be neighborly. just somethin' we do. right. i'm sorry. thank you. and here we are. oh, no. that's a beaut, huh?

okay. yeah. i think he's in his s and still working full time. oh, it's a wonder he's still above ground. so, old doc hired ya, huh? well, hope mccrea did the actual hiring. aah. i'm so sorry. i don't know your name. i'm melinda monroe. people call me mel. i'm vernon. people call me doc mullins. and for the record, missy, i'm . oh. oh, what is that? oh! hello? hello? hi. melinda! i'm hope mccrea. as the mayor of virgin river, i'd like to officially welcome you to our little slice of heaven. hi, hope. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i just. i'm a little confused. um. this is what you sent me. the. this farmhouse chic cabin. nestled in the woods of northern california is designed to enjoy all the trappings of country life? like. farmhouse chic is not an accurate description of this property. i admit, i. i haven't gotten around to taking a more current photo. okay, well, the job i accepted included housing for a year. and i obviously can't stay here. um. i'll have it cleaned. was that. did you just put a bird's. is that a bird's nest from the oven? you did come a bit early. no, i didn't. i'm three days late. well, no need to get all twisted up. well. i can wake up the fitches. jo ellen and nick rent out their extra rooms. of course, the husband's a bit handsy. he pretends it's an accident, but it isn't. um. anyway, you look like you can take care of yourself. uh. oh, well, at least the fridge is stocked with gourmet foods and beverages. i was going to take care of that earlier, but we. we had a ribbon cutting ceremony over at the firehouse. got ourselves a new hose. when did you eat last? why? hungry equals cranky. and between us gals, you don't wear cranky well. hm. head to jack's. by the time you get back, i'll have the hot water running and fresh towels and blankets. who's jack? i. jack's bar. only place to eat in town after five. you can walk. out the door and to the left. okay, but we're not done talking about this. of course we aren't. bye. .love you're bringin' trouble you keep me hangin' i think it's great. i know! i'm givin' love you're bringin' trouble you keep me hangin' on your line i get the feelin' it's gettin' heavy the situation ricky. yeah? more glasses, please. uh, sure, boss. so, what are we havin'? whiskey? soda? wine? you look like a wine person. you need a minute? uh, no. uh, any chance of getting a cosmo? nope. not unless you brought your own cointreau. i did not. uh. so, mixed drinks are not. not our thing. but i have all the boys, johnnie, jack, and jim. all the regular stuff and beer. just no frills. all right, make it a jim straight up. okay. i commend you on your choice. huh. thank you. mm hm. the feelin' is quite deceivin' well, i didn't know city girls could shoot whiskey. what makes you think i'm a city girl? come on. cosmo? manicure? cartier? wow. you should be a detective. no. my days of tracking bad guys are over. what? sorry. we don't get a lot of visitors. certainly not as beautiful as you. i'm sorry. does that line really work? oh, you'd be surprised. well, you're lucky we're not in los angeles, because angelinos can smell bs a mile away. oh, really? that's one of the reasons why i love living here so much. people aren't so jaded. i'm jack sheridan. mel monroe. so, is this your bar? well, it will be in about more payments. so, miss mel monroe from la, what brings you to our tiny little hamlet? work. yeah? where you staying? uh, the mccrea cabin. oof. what'd you do to deserve that? yeah, i should have come up and vetted the place first. oh, come on. i think spontaneity's an admirable quality. oh, no. you. you can't credit me with being spontaneous. no, it once took me six months to buy a cr pe pan. six months. six months. yeah, i usually check everything three times, and then i check it again. used to drive my. so, how long you here for? um. a year. i'm working with dr. mullins. i'm a nurse. oh, that should be an experience. yeah. i imagine it's gonna resemble the cabin. uncomfortable. exactly. i think you might be right. so, you know dr. mullins? oh, everybody knows everybody around here. small town. right. and it's doc. he does not like formalities. oh, well, he does not like me. i basically called him old. but in my defense, i didn't know it was him i was talking to when i said it. he is old. i know, right? thank you. preacher, mel. mel, preacher. hi. yeah, he's a man of few words, but he's a good friend, and he's a great cook. mm. um. this is amazing. what is this? squirrel. mm. that was too easy. that's not funny. you're dining on squash and lentils. you know what? i actually have had squirrel, and if it's done right, it's pretty tasty. okay, well, i'm gonna take your word on that. oh, no, no, no. if i have any more, i won't be able to find the cabin. which might not be a bad thing, so. it's fine. it's my car. god bless you, bert. i can't sleep in that. you certainly can't drive. oh, no, no, no. no. i mean, leaving town's just not even an option. would you like to know why? i will tell you. because. i sold my house. and most of my belongings. and then i quit my job. and i moved to this town that i've never heard of just so i could live in there. yep. so. i hate it when joey's right. you know? husband? sister. yeah. well. if i had a spare room, i'd offer, but. oh, no, no, no. that's sweet, but it's. it's fine. i'll just, you know, it'll be one night. it'll be like camping. right? yeah, sure. oh. mm hm. oh. it's not that bad, right? well. perspective is most often the key to happiness. so, what you're saying is that acclimation is possible. oh, yeah. just try not to insult any more residents. thank you, jack. thank you for the. the help, and the kind words, and food. but mostly, thank you for the whiskey. any time, mel. hey, mark, do you know which box the towels are in? no. but i found a set of sheets. oh. mm. what are you doing with this? i'm drying my hands. uh uh. this is personally autographed by bob seger and the entire silver bullet band. handed down to me by my father, who was at cobo hall in detroit on the night of the live recording of their very first album. now, one beautiful day in the not too distant future, i'm gonna hand this on to our son, mark junior. mm. and he to his son, mark junior junior. and so on and so forth. mm. what if we have a girl? hmm. what if we have a girl? oh! oh, mark, stop! oh! come on! i hate this place. god. ugh! it's too early for lectures. hey, i didn't say a thing. yeah, you didn't have to. so? the pretty lady make it home last night? she had a ring on. yeah, i wasn't sure you noticed. i did. that gun's not loaded, right? okay. uh, first, i just wanted to say thank you for stopping and helping me last night. and second, i would like to apologize for what i said. the part where you called me old or the part where you said i can't handle my practice? in my defense, i was told by mrs. mccrea that you were elderly and nearing retirement. it took me years to build this practice from scratch. no help. no nurse. i don't need ya. well, i signed a contract. hah. not with me, you didn't. i don't even recall interviewing you, but maybe that's. that's just my dementia actin' up. well, i was hired to do a job, and i'm here to do that job. you know, in this county, trespassers can be shot. on sight. uh, i'm not trespassing. do you work here? no. are you a patient here? no. did i invite you in? no. if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, that is a duck. okay. what are you gonna do, shoot me? oh ho ho. well, it's finally happened. you've lost your damn mind. ow. you threatened her with a gun? i simply educated her on some of our local laws. you are a stubborn goat. i think you mean stubborn old goat. you're old. i'm old. it's not a secret. i told you i would find somebody myself. maybe i should just go. go! stay! i gave you an entire year. this is not your business. this town depends on both of us. and who put you in charge? the town did when they elected me mayor. you ran unopposed. the point is, i won. you are the only one who thinks i need any help. the only one. bull. everyone thinks you need help. they're just too scared to tell you. vernon, we both know you can't be in two places at once. even for you, that was low. i thought you were dead. hey, i'm sorry, sis. i. yeah, i was about to call out the national guard. well, they probably wouldn't be able to find this place, anyway. what's wrong? nothing. i'm fi. i'm fine. i'm worried about you. just tell me what's goin' on. um, nothing. nothing, nothing. i'm. fine. i just. it's just this doctor that i'm working for doesn't want me here. and this cabin i'm in, it's just. it's just awful. and i. i just feel really alone right now. mel, you are not alone. okay? come back here. you can stay with us for as long as you want. mel, stop trying to punish yourself for what happened. nobody blames you. just come home. honey, all you changed by moving was your address. i'm sorry, joe. i'm gonna call you tomorrow, okay? i love you. no. hey. i've got goat, beef, venison, rabbit, and buffalo. uh. any fish? you know, you should try the salad with the shaved brussels sprouts and kale. kale? yeah. all of preacher's vegetables are farm to table, and the farm is about feet from the table. okay, great. well, i'll have that salad, please. thanks for the assist. i'm paige lassiter. i run the bakery truck. hi. i'm mel. monroe. yeah, the new nurse. in small towns, the internet is slow, but the gossip is fast. right. is that a celine bag? um. yes, it is. i'm probably the only person in virgin river with a subscription to vogue. so, this. um. anyway, you should stop by for a muffin or something. oh? yeah. us girls should stick together. absolutely. okay. it's nice to meet you. you too. look. you are a brilliant doctor. huh. but when you're finally ready to hang up your stethoscope, you'll be leaving behind a gaping hole in this community. i don't even know her. she ranked top of her class at uc irvine, did her practical at county usc, then she spent five years working emergency at cedars sinai. her references are good as gold. then what the heck's she doin' here? i guess she. wanted a change. even if you're too stubborn to admit it, we both know you need help. give her a chance. you got nothing to lose. thirty days. but. if she can't cut it, i've got your word this is the last time you stick your nose in my business. ooh. good choice. this is so delicious. well, you sound surprised. oh, no, it's totally normal to have a gourmet kale and brussels sprout salad at a bar in the middle of nowhere surrounded by animal heads. you want something to drink? i would kill for a latte. sorry. nearest starbucks, miles away. really? mm hm. you know there's a starbucks in kuala lumpur? um, nurses beyond borders. oh. a humanitarian. there's so many things to learn about you, huh? hm. yeah, well, according to doc, i'm an ageist. well, good thing i'm still relatively young and attractive. you know, looks have nothing to do with it. you're the only restaurant in town. oh, yeah, you keep telling yourself that. what i keep telling myself is that i'm crazy for not packing up and going home. good news. doc's not gonna throw you a parade, but he agreed to try you out. you start immediately. hope, you've already hired me. well, here's the thing. i'm paying your salary, but it is his practice, so. why didn't you just tell me that? honey, then you wouldn't have come, would you? like my father said to my mother at the altar, you're already here, so let's make the best of it. hmm. well, i'm not staying in that shack another night. i gotta side with mel on that one. you stay out of this. do i need to remind you that we have a. oh, oh, i'm fully aware that we have a contract. okay? i'm also aware that suitable housing was part of the deal, so technically, you're in breach. which means the contract is null and void. i can leave whenever i want. can you afford to have her leave? no. well, why don't you get her a room at the fitches'? i'll fix up the cabin. ricky could help me. i'm not made of money. hope, please don't poor mouth to me. you and i both know you couldn't spend half of what you have if you tried. you're offering an awful lot of yourself to help a complete stranger. oh, hope, i thought you knew me better than that. jack, i've known you a long time. if mel was short for melvin, we wouldn't be having this conversation. i believe hope has some good news for you. i'll put you up at the fitches' while i figure out what to do with the cabin. the place with the handsy husband? did i say that? you know, i can fight my own battles. never turn down help when deep in a foxhole. how about a show of virgin river hospitality? why don't i take you on a tour tomorrow? okay, tell you what. i'm gonna be at the river at seven a.m. if you want to join me, i'll be there. uh. hey. uh, so, should i just pull up a chart and grab a patient? no. no? no. until i can confirm that you are competent, no patients. well, how can you confirm my competency if i can't see any patients? chitchat is over. i've got a waitin' room full of people. welcome. hi. oh, i am sorry that my husband isn't here to greet you as well. oh. he's doing a supply run in grace valley. we only have one room left, and, uh. i'm nervous that you won't like it. hope told me that you're very picky. yeah. come take a look. okay. after you. thank you. boy, you picked the wrong place to rob. get your hands up. now turn around. slowly. oh ho ho! come on. hey, man. brady! bro, what are you doing in here, man? i was leaving you a note. wanted to let you know i was okay. how the hell did you get in here? come on. i know where you keep the spare key. listen, i. i've got plans this morning. but why don't you go get something to eat, and then go up to my room, grab some sleep, and then clean yourself up, okay? all right. long time. welcome back. thanks, man. yeah. hey! hey. are you coming up, or am i coming down? you're comin' down here. okay. oh, i see you got a coffee. yeah. paige's bakery truck. you could have mentioned it. i believe in self discovery. ah. and practicality. ah! yeah. no, thank you. no, no, no. i insist. where are we going? i cleared your morning with doc. you cleared my morning. well, there's no cell reception out here, so i figured you wouldn't want to give doc any more ammunition by being late, so. wow. but let me help you. no, no. i don't need your assistance, okay? okay. i'm sorry i called doc for you. it won't happen again. now, you wanna put your hand on my shoulder? okay, now step. oh. and. other one. step. okay. all right. we can leave this here. wait. no. no, no, no. my whole life is in that bag. oh, look, no one's gonna take it. hm? because no one's here. trust me? hm. aah. mm. hey, thank you. uh. how much further? we're almost there. wow. it's not even the best part. eagles. here. this is their favorite spot. mine too. they're incredible. huh. yeah. so, what's next? nothin'. here. oh, thank you. yeah. aah. i think i can actually hear my heart beating. in peace, nothing so becomes a man. or woman. .as modest stillness. shakespeare? mm. you an english major? hm? no, i never went to college. but in my s, i loved to read while drinkin', so it kind of all evens out. uh. is that hunters? yeah, could be. could be somethin' else. there's a lot of illegal pot fields outside of virgin river. but it's legal now. yeah. it doesn't stop the illegal growers from doin' business. cross them, and things can turn dangerous. i used to work in the, uh. er level one trauma center, so i've seen my fair share of what dangerous can do. er, huh? sounds like an intense job. yeah, you could say that. but i'm sure owning a bar has its challenges. piece of cake, compared to my time in the service. marine. joined up right out of high school. spent plus years, mostly in the middle east. preacher was with me. and brady. you haven't met him yet. wow. do you miss it? yes and no. i had, um. people who. depended on me. and virgin river, well, it's, uh. it's a utopia, compared to a war zone. oh, here. oh. come on. aah. thank you. you're welcome. thanks for this morning. it was my pleasure. well, i'll see you around. yeah, you will. see ya. bye. hello? doc? is doc here? hi, there. no, no, he's not in right now. he'll be back soon. i'll wait. uh. i'm the new nurse practitioner. maybe i can help you. uh. oh, i'll wait for doc. ooh. um. when are you due? ooh. any day now. it's okay. okay. i think i should take a look at you. i don't know when the doctor'll be back. okay? okay. okay. can you stand? okay. uh. yeah. yeah. it's okay. just take a breath. ready? one, two, three. up. okay. there you go. it's okay. you're gonna be just fine. okay? okay. yeah. what's your name? polly. polly fishburn. polly fishburn. my name's mel. and i'm gonna take really good care of you, okay? okay. you're gonna be just fine now. can you get up on this table? yeah. got it? you got it. you got it. yeah. i've gone through last night's receipts twice. mm hm? the cash box is light. oh, y. you know what? i advanced ricky a week to prep the mccrea cabin for some maintenance. i. i thought i logged that. must have forgotten. oh, look who's back in town. brady. so, how long before you disappear again? i told him he could stay as long as he wants. mm. i'm gonna head to clear river. run some errands. catch you in a bit. yeah. uh, i left. a lot of kids behind who i couldn't help. i can help brady, okay? i'm not turning my back on him. well, then, you may wanna change the locks on the office door. or you may be advancing ricky a whole lot more than a week's pay. what is goin' on? i'm with a patient. no, i. i'm almost done. i'll be right out. is everything okay? you're doing fine. your baby is doing fine, okay? you're just having. some braxton hicks. oh. false labor pains. they don't feel false though, do they? no. no. uh. why don't you just lay here and rest, and i'll go call your husband to come pick you up, okay? okay. thanks, mel. you're very welcome. who said you could give her an exam? i was just doing my job. this is my practice. my name is on that door. you do not work with a patient unless you have my permission. polly was having braxton hicks. i had to examine her to make sure that she wasn't in premature labor. did you know there's protein in her urine? don't lecture me about my patient. well, it's not in her chart. i don't put everything in the chart. uh huh. okay, well, where do you put it? right here. and if you're not here to tell me what's not in the chart? my dear, i'm not just old, i'm old school. and in my day, a nurse would never, never question the methods of a supervising physician. a nurse would know her place. well, i hope you'll join me in the st century. and your point is? this time it was false labor, but what about the next polly or whoever? wh. do you want me to just stand by and watch someone bleed out if you're not here? you should have called me. i had things under control. these patients, they are like my family. and i cannot trust you with them unless i know for sure you're not gonna hurt someone. so, if i can't do what i was hired to do, what is it that you want me to do? well, straighten up the office. file things. uh. keep the coffee pot full. i like mine black and fresh. hello, polly. he's refusing to let me do my job. give it time. no, no, no, no, no. this is not about time. okay, good medicine is about teamwork, and he doesn't want me on his team. he'll come around. he is rude, he is demeaning, and he's a big time chauvinist. the man's got his quirks, i'll give you that. it's obvious that he needs somebody, but it's not gonna work like this, okay? it needs to be his idea, or he's never gonna accept it. my grandfather was just like him. so, you understand. yeah, and he's never gonna change. look, hope, the bottom line is that this is not what i signed up for. join the club, sweetheart. life rarely gives us what we want. okay. i didn't join a club, okay? i took a job. i'm sorry, i have to give you notice. i'll give you time to find someone, but you need to start looking now. i took my love and i took it down i climbed a mountain and i turned around she's so beautiful. and i saw my reflection so, where's bill?

okay. you know i rarely agree with your sister. can i sail mm hm. through the changing ocean tides? she's right. can i handle the seasons i have to run. sorry. of my life? oh, oh well, i've been 'fraid of changin' 'cause i've built my life around you but time makes you bolder children get older and i'm getting older, too so take this love and take it down yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills well, the landslide brought me down and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills well, maybe hey, mel. jack? well, maybe you better take a look at this. well, maybe jesus. i'm pretty sure that's not jesus
