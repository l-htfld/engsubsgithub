you make a million decisions that mean nothing and then one day you order takeout that changes your life. destiny takes a hand. mum, destiny is something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental. then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else, like tuna? well, it wasn't a sign. it was a coincidence. i was in atlantic city with my family, cliff was a waiter. he wasn't even supposed to work that night. suppose he hadn't? he asked me to take a midnight walk on the steel pier. i probably told you this a million times, but i don't care. then he held my hand. at one point i looked down and i couldn't tell which fingers were his and which were mine. and i knew. what? you know. what? magic. it was magic. magic. i knew we'd be together forever. and that everything would be wonderful. just the way you feel about walter. walter. it's quite a formal name. one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time in the sack, i believe you call it. mum. of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department. so don't be worried if it takes a while. we already. fine, fine. fiddly dee. how's it working?

oh, well, it was a million tiny, little things. when you added them all up, it just meant we were supposed to be together. and i knew it, i knew it the very first time i touched her. it was like coming home, only to no home i'd ever known. i was just taking her hand to help her out of a car. and i knew it. it was like magic. magic. fieldstone well, folks, it's time to wrap it up. i'm dr. marcia fieldstone in chicago. and to all my listeners, a magical and merry christmas. and to you, sleepless in seattle, we hope you'll call again soon and let us know how it's going. sam oh, you can count on it. ray charles' over the rainbow plays i know somewhere over the rainbow the blue birds fly birds fly over the rainbow why then, oh why can't i?

it was on minutes over those cows that got zapped by stray voltage. no one knows why. and maybe it was wisconsin. but, anyway, i was listening to him talk about how much he loved his wife and suddenly i was crying. it's like what happens when i watch those phone company ads. i don't have to see the whole thing, just the part where the daughter gives the mother the refrigerator with the big red bow. yes. the polaroid commercial, two year olds at their grandfather's birthday party. they're making the album. that kills me! you should write something about this. about what? becky whatever it is. i tell you what it is two thousand women calling a radio station for a husband? there are a lot of desperate women out there looking for love. especially over a certain age. you know it's easier to be killed by a terrorist than it is to get married over . that is not true. that statistic is not true. that's right, it's not true. but it feels true. it feels true because it's true. there is practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true. calm down, you brought it up. i did not, wyatt. did you even read that book? did anybody read that book all the way through? are you two finished? fine, now where were we? if someone's a widower, why do they say that he was he widowed ? why don't they say he was widowered ? i was just wondering. becky what was that about up there? what was what? what's with you? annie nothing's with me. becky something's with you. what are you saying? whatever it is, you can tell me. sleepless in seattle? that's what she called him on the show because he can't sleep. and now women want his number. the guy could be a crackhead, a transvestite, a flasher, a junkie, a chainsaw murderer or someone really sick, someone like my rick. actually, he sounded nice. oh?

and could the whole front of the house open on a hinge so i can get in with a garage opener. yes, we can. we'll just. move the kitchen cabinets. hey, jonah, bring some of that stuff around, all right? do you like baseball? yes, i do. in fact my firm has box seats to the mariners. why don't we all go some time. hey! what about camping? what about it? do you like camping? i went camping once. you know, dad, we should start camping more often. you're right. camping is good. time for bed. it's only . yeah, . time for bed. good night. hey, don't you wanna thank victoria for this delicious dinner? thanks for dinner. i never saw anybody cook potatoes that way. i'm glad you liked it. good night, jonah. yeah, we don't see a lot of potatoes around here. we're rice men. victoria oh, god. oh! oh! ow. i'm sorry, walter. i'm sorry. hello. becky turn on your radio. what? the kid is on. you've got me listening to this garbage. go, turn it on. who is it? it's becky. she's having trouble with rick again. i'll go downstairs. becky, i'll call you back. i'm sorry, walter. are you bleeding? jonah he's kissing her right this minute! fieldstone oh, really? jonah, tell the truth are you spying on your father? who is he kissing? jonah i have to make them stop. how will i explain this to walter? jonah she came over and cooked dinner. she brought two bags of groceries like she was staying here for a year! fieldstone jonah, it's good that your father's dating. it's just hard on you. it's something you think you want, but then when it happens, it scares you. jonah that's not true. fieldstone okay, now think. shouldn't your father be the judge of whether someone is right or wrong for him? jonah he's not sane enough to judge anything. now he's kissing her on the lips. my dad's been captured by a ho! what am i going to do? fieldstone jonah, calm down. tomorrow, when you're sitting down to breakfast, tell him how you feel. it's not good to keep your feelings inside you. miss scarlet. in the broom closet. with the radio. walter, you scared me. don't ever do that again. i thought i saw a black widow spider. you scared me to death. you scared victoria to death. it was right over there. next time you think you see a black widow spider i want you to say dad, excuse me, but i believe a poisonous insect is in the house. and i will calmly come and take care of it. you scream like that again, i'll kill you. becky heard this guy on the radio, she was sure it was rick. she was completely hysterical. and then it turned out the guy lived in duluth. where's duluth? that doesn't make any sense. i know. i know, walter. it doesn't make any sense at all. thank god my life is in place. duluth? that's in north dakota. i love this letter. you have to write to her. you think so? it's y o h. yeah. what's that? your only hope. i thought i would look into doing a story on those radio shows. you'd have to go somewhere to really look into them. definitely. couldn't you do a phone interview? not for the kind of piece i wanna do. i won't be in chicago long. when you get back, i'll be gone. then i'll see you in new york. i'll get it. pilot this is captain browning. we're cruising at , feet. the weather is clear to the west and we'll be in seattle on schedule. don't you hate flying? yes, i do. and i've just told the most terrible one to the man i'm about to marry. do you feel that any lie is a betrayal? i said flying. oh. thanks for bringing me here. well, he likes the planes. can i bring something back for you? a souvenir? does he like those little snow globes? you know, you shake them up and then the snow floats down. sure, i'd really like that. thank you so much. he's . he's good at it. i've read an article about this. children are hideous at the age of . it's quite normal. well. maybe when i come back, the two of us ought to spend some time together on our own. what do you think? bye. bye, jonah. bye. jonah. listen to me. you don't know victoria. i hardly know her myself. she's, in fact, a mystery to me. she tosses her hair a lot. why does she do this? i have no idea. is it a twitch? does she need a haircut? could she use a barrette to keep her hair out of her face? these are the things i'm willing to get to the bottom of. that is why i am dating her. that's all i'm doing. i'm not living with her. i'm not marrying her. can you appreciate the difference? this is what single people do. they try other people on and see how they fit. but everybody's an adjustment. nobody's perfect. there's no such thing as a perfect. come on. dad, i was talking to jessica about reincarnation. she says you knew annie in another life. sam who's annie? the one who wrote us. but jessica says, you and annie never got together in that life. so your hearts are like puzzles with missing pieces. and when you get together, the puzzle's complete. goddamn it. the reason i know this and you don't, is because i'm younger and pure, so i'm more in touch with cosmic forces. who told you this stuff? jessica. i sincerely hope you're not marrying jessica. harry connick, jr.'s a wink and a smile plays i remember the days of just keeping time of hanging around in sleepy towns forever back roads empty for miles well, you can't have a dream and cut it to fit but when i saw you, i knew we'd go together like a wink and a smile leave your old jalopy by the railroad track we'll get a hip double dip tip toppy two seat pontiac so you can rev her up don't go slow it's only green lights and all rights let's go together with a wink and a smile give me a wink and a smile we go together like a wink and a smile now my heart is music such a simple song sing it again the notes never end this is where i belong just the sound of your voice the light in your eyes we're so far away from yesterday together with a wink and a smile we go together like a wink and a smile annie i watched him play with his son at the beach. becky did you talk to him? couldn't do it. how did i get here? you told a lie and got on a plane. that's not what i mean. i'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. i am. okay. good. goodbye. beck. what? is this crazy? no, that's the weirdest part about it. thank you. i love you. i love you too. good night. bye. it's so good to see you. where's greg? hello. becky so then what happened? annie so then i left, obviously. you were standing in the middle of the street? you know that dream when you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you. i love that dream. that was nothing compared to this humiliation. nothing! but he saw you, right? he saw me. you were face to face. he said hello. he said hello. and what did you say? and all i could say was hello. oh, my god. kerr all i could say was hello. it's a sign. it's a sign that i have watched this movie too many times. so stupid! from the minute i listened to that stupid programme on the radio, i've been a complete jerk. you are not a jerk. thank you. an idiot! you don't know who she was, annie. i saw her. i have a picture of her. i'll show you a picture of her. that detective in seattle sent me a picture of her. here! see, that's exactly what she looks like. this is a picture of someone's back. well, it's her and he was crazy about her. what's this? this is from seattle. becky. so i mailed your letter. dear annie. thanks for your letter. it was great. you sound neat. we're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine's day and seeing if we are. m f e o. see you soon. sleepless in seattle. m f e o? made for each other. it's cute. it's like a little clue. so he can't write. big deal. verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy. and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble. i'm going to run back to walter's arms, if he'll still have me. what about the letter? it's nothing. it was written before i went out there. before the ho. the only thing is, she didn't look like a ho. she looked like somebody we would have been friends with. ugh! you saw her in the airport and then here? and i tried to talk to her. it was like i knew her or something. it was weird. you mean like a d j vu thing? it was very french d j vu ish kind of thing. oui? oui. at least you're out there seeing people again. that's terrific. well, i mean, there's really just the one. victoria. you don't like victoria? she laughs like a hyena. is this true? no! sort of. yeah, a little bit. but, tell them what you did. dad. sam tell them about the radio show. go ahead. dad. they wanna hear it. go ahead. tell them. tell them. christmas eve, he phones in one of those radio call in shows. and tells them i need a new wife. oh, you're kidding. that's so sweet. now he's obsessed with this one woman who wrote me. are you serious? yeah. she wants to meet me at the top of empire state building. on valentine's day. it's like that movie. what movie? an affair to remember. did you ever see it? oh, god. cary grant and deborah kerr. is that karr or kerr ? kerr. karr. okay. she's gonna meet him at the top of the empire state building. only she got hit by a taxi. and he waited and waited. and it was raining, i think. and then she's too proud to tell him that she's. crippled. and he's too proud to find out why she doesn't come. but he comes to see her anyway. and i forget why, but. oh, it's so amazing when he comes to see her. because he doesn't even notice that she doesn't get up to say hello. and he's very bitter. you think he's just going to walk out the door and never know why. she's just lying there, you know. like, on the couch with this blanket over her shrivelled little legs. and. are you all right? she's fine. and suddenly, he goes, i saw the painting and he, like, goes to the bedroom. and he looks, and he comes out and looks at her. and he kind of just. they know and hug and it's so. that's a chick's movie. i would say so. what kind of a person would write to someone they heard on the radio? i got hundreds of letters from women all over the country. desperate women. just because someone is looking for a nice guy, it doesn't make them desperate. how about rapacious and love starved? no. it's easier to be killed by a terrorist than to find a husband after the age of . that is absolutely untrue! right, honey. right. well, i'm not looking for a mail order bride. i just want somebody that i can have a decent conversation with over dinner. you know, without it falling down into weepy tears over some movie that she just saw. she's very emotional. although, i cried at the end of the dirty dozen. well, who didn't? jim brown was throwing these hand grenades down these air shafts. and richard jaeckel and lee marvin we sitting on top of this armoured personnel carrier. they were dressed up like nazis. and it was. trini lopez. trini lopez. he busted his neck when they were parachuting down behind the nazi lines. stop it! richard jaeckel, at the beginning, he had on a shiny helmet, because he was an mp. please, no more. god, i love that movie. this is the best movie i've ever seen in my life. what's so great about it? you have to find her, jonah. you have to go to her. do you know how much money it costs to go to new york? nobody knows. it changes practically every day. how much money do you have? dollars. i have . that'll probably cover cabs. but how would i get there? honey, i have to run these tickets over to someone. can you keep an eye on things out front till i get back? sure, mum. you want a window seat or aisle? window. you want a fruit plate? i don't know. do i? i'd rather die than eat airplane food. i'm telling them you're so you can fly unaccompanied and the stewardess won't carry you around and stuff like that. are you crazy? who'd believe i'm ? if it's in the computer, they'll believe anything. are you sure? do you want me to say that you're really, really short for your age, and they shouldn't say anything because it would hurt your feelings? yeah. that's a great idea! tammy wynette's stand by your man plays sometimes it's hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man walter. you're gonna miss the train. no, i'm not. i'm so happy, becky. finally, i feel happy. this is right. this is real. everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies. and you completely lose sight of what counts. please, don't tell anybody what happened. because i would be so absolutely mortified if anyone knew i did anything even remotely close to what i have done. thank you, thank you. do you promise? i promise. sleepless in seattle is history. . hard to understand and if you love him oh, be proud of him 'cause after all he's just a man stand by your man i was just. i was just. go ahead. no, you go. okay. well, i was just gonna say that ever since christmas. you've been different, kind of distracted, distant. but now it feels as if you're coming back from wherever you were. i am. i was just. i just. i just got. i think i got nervous. but that's normal, right? i mean, don't you ever feel nervous about. you know? what? forever. no. well. i did. and. you know what i think? i think i thought it was too perfect, you know. i started to wonder if we were the human equivalent of two rights making a wrong. you know what it was? it was like kismet, but not, if you see what i mean. you have to grow up. you just can't keep having all these adolescent fantasies about. how exciting life is gonna be. don't hate me, but i love this pattern. you couldn't. i do. this is just like my grandmother's china. how many place settings? ten. ten. exactly. eight is too few, twelve is both too many. walter. it was my mother's. i had them size it down. she had really fat fingers. it's so beautiful. it's exactly what i'd pick out if i had every ring in the whole world to choose from. you see what i mean? there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but i am not one of those people. no, siree. surprises are highly overrated. sam i'm leaving first thing in the morning, but i'm only gonna be gone one night. clarise is gonna be here. so you'll be able to see plenty of geraldo and nightmare on elm street . i will never know. are you going with her? i'm going with victoria, yes. don't try anything tricky. understand? don't go rolling in poison ivy as soon as i leave the house. or lock yourself in the closet or do anything that makes you need stitches. if your finger falls off, it's staying off. no one's gonna pack it on ice and take you to hospital, so that you can be a breakthrough in laser surgery. is this about that woman in baltimore? annie. i don't care what you do! good! fine! i'll tell you what i'm doing this weekend. i'm getting laid. s and nobody's getting laid. i'm the only man in the america who's getting laid this weekend. and i haven't been laid that much. six girls in college. maybe seven. how long have you been there? forever. what did you hear me just say? six girls in college. maybe seven. seven. eight! mary kelly. this is the one i like. jonah, the fact is, you're not gonna like any woman, because it isn't your mother. how do you know? what's wrong with annie? oh, jonah, shut up! shut up? shut up? mum never said shut up to me. mum never yelled at me. this conversation is finished. why can't we go to new york? there is no way that we are going on a plane to meet some woman who could be a crazy, sick lunatic. didn't you see fatal attraction? you wouldn't let me. well, i saw it! and it scared the shit out of me. it scared the shit out of every man in america! i'm not leaving till you say yes. i hate you! i hate you! i hate you! that's good! you'll have a lot to tell oprah how your dad destroyed your life because he had to go off for a weekend special at the holiday inn! jonah, clarise is here and i've got to go. hey, jonah. jonah? all right. jonah, listen, i've got to go. jonah. hey, jonah. jonah! jessica, honey. you have tell us where he is. jonah's daddy is very upset. jessica, this is your father. tell us where he is. right this minute! n y. sam what is that?

no, i'm cynthia. excuse me, are you annie? great table. thanks. is something wrong? can i get you a drink? some champagne? fine. fine. can we have a bottle of dom deluise. just kidding. it was a joke. he meant dom perignon. i got it. ohh. beautiful view. walter. there's something i have to tell you. hey! sorry, i have an emergency. sam money, money, money, see? so he could be on top of the empire state building now? no. i guess he could be. no. it's not him, walter. it's me. i can't do this. look, annie, i love you. but let's leave that out of this. i don't want to be someone that you're settling for. i don't want to be someone that anyone settles for. marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it. isn't it? walter, i don't deserve you. no, i wouldn't put it that way. but okay. you okay? yeah. what? look. it's a sign. who needed a sign? walter, i have to go. jonah! dad! dad! jonah? what if something happened to you? what if i couldn't get to you? i'm sorry. i'm sorry. what would i have done? you are my family. you're all i've got. i thought she'd be here. i thought she'd come. we're doing okay, aren't we? i mean, are we okay? aren't we all right? so far, have i done anything stupid? no. have i screwed it up for the both of us? no. observation deck? sorry, ma'am, but it's too late. oh. no, please. i really need to get up there. we're closing up. no more runs tonight. listen. can i just take a look? there's someone i was supposed to meet. he's probably not there, but if i don't at least look, i'll always wonder about it. cary grant, right? you know that movie? it's one of my wife's favourites. maybe when we get home, we'll get a dog. jonah okay. sam what do you mean, okay? wouldn't you like to have a dog? jonah sure. i'm sorry, ma'am. empty. can i take a minute? go ahead. i left it by the telescopes. it's you. it's me. i saw you in the street. are you annie? yes. you're annie?
