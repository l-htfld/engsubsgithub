 a handsome young prince. lived in a beautiful castle. poof! poof! although he had everything his heart desired. the prince was selfish and unkind. master, it's time. he taxed the village. to fill his castle with the most beautiful objects. and his parties with the most beautiful people. oh, how divine glamour, music and magic combine see the maidens so anxious to shine look for a sign that enhances chances she'll be his special one what a display what a breathtaking, thrilling array ev'ry prince ev'ry dog has his day let us sing with passion, gusto, fit to bust, oh not a care in the world then one night. an unexpected intruder arrived at the castle. seeking shelter from the bitter storm. as a gift, she offered the prince, a single rose. repulsed by her haggard appearance. the prince turned the woman away. hmm. but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances. for beauty is found within. when he dismissed her again. the old woman's outward appearance melted away. to reveal. a beautiful enchantress. the prince begged for forgiveness, but it was too late. for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. chip! chip! oh, my! as punishment. she transformed him into a hideous beast. and placed a powerful spell on the castle. and all who lived there. as days bled into years. the prince and his servants were forgotten by the world. for the enchantress had erased all memory of them. from the minds of the people they loved. but the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose. if he could learn to love another. and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell. the spell would be broken. if not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. as the years passed. he fell into despair and lost all hope. for who could ever learn to love a beast?

who are you? who are you? i've come for my father. your father is a thief. liar! he stole a rose. i asked for the rose. punish me, not him. no! he means forever. apparently, that's what happens around here when you pick a flower. a life sentence for a rose? i received eternal damnation for one. i'm merely locking him away. now, do you still wish to take your father's place? come into the light. choose. belle, i won't let you do this. i lost your mother. i won't lose you, too. now, go. go! all right, papa. i'll leave. i need a minute alone with him. are you so cold hearted. you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye?

i will never marry you, gaston! you know, there are other girls. a great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits. gosh it disturbs me to see you, gaston looking so down in the dumps every guy here'd love to be you, gaston even when taking your lumps there's no man in town as admired as you you're everyone's favorite guy everyone's awed and inspired by you and it's not very hard to see why no one's slick as gaston no one's quick as gaston no one's neck's as incredibly thick as gaston for there's no man in town half as manly perfect, a pure paragon you can ask any tom, dick, or stanley and they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on who plays darts like gaston? who breaks hearts like gaston? who's much more than the sum of his parts like gaston? as a specimen, yes, i'm intimidating my, what a guy, that gaston i needed encouragement thank you, lefou well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you too much? yep! no one fights like gaston douses lights like gaston in a wrestling match nobody bites like gaston when i hunt, i sneak up with my quiver and beasts of the field say a prayer aah. first i carefully aim for the liver then i shoot from behind is that fair? i don't care no one hits like gaston matches wits like gaston in a spitting match nobody spits like gaston i'm especially good at expectorating ooh! ten points for gaston! thank you. thank you. when i was a lad i ate four dozen eggs every morning to help me get large and now that i'm grown i eat five dozen eggs so i'm roughly the size of a barge hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! who has brains like gaston entertains like gaston who can make up these endless refrains like gaston i use antlers in all of my decorating say it again who's a man among men? who's a super success? don't you know? can't you guess? ask his fans and his five hangers on there's just one guy in town who's got all of it down and his name's, g a s t i believe there's another 't' it just occurred to me that i'm illiterate and i've never actually had to spell it out loud before gaston oh, lefou, you're the best. how is it no girl has snatched you up yet? i've been told i'm clingy, but i really don't get it. please, please. someone, someone. you, help. whoa, whoa. you must help me. it's belle! he's got, he's got belle. she's locked in a dungeon. who's got her? a beast! a huge, horrid, monstrous beast! my daughter's life is in danger. why do you laugh? it's not a joke. his castle is hidden in the woods. it's already winter there. winter in june? crazy old maurice! listen to me! the beast is real. do you understand? will no one help me? i'll help, maurice. what? you will? everybody. stop making fun of this man at once. captain, thank you. don't thank me, maurice. lead us to the beast. come. hmm. oh. mama! there's a girl in the castle! yes, chip, we know! what kind of tea does she like?

no, no, no. he gave her a bedroom. this is true. but if this girl is the one who can break the spell. then maybe you could start by using dinner to charm her. good thinking, cogsworth. what? that's the most ridiculous idea. i've ever heard. charm the prisoner! but you must try, master. with every passing day. we become less human. she's the daughter of a common thief. what kind of person do you think that makes her? oh, you can't judge people. by who their father is, now can you? you'll join me for dinner. that's not a request. gently, master. the girl lost her father. and her freedom in one day. yes, the poor thing is probably in there, scared to death. exactly. just a minute. you see? there she is. now, remember, be gentle. kind! charming! sweet! and when she opens the door, give her a dashing, debonair smile. come, come. show me the smile. oh, mon dieu! oh, no. will you join me for dinner? you've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? are you insane? uh oh. he's losing it. oh, dear! i told you to join me for dinner. and i told you no. ooh! what time is it? what's happening? i'd starve before i ever ate with you. well, be my guest. go ahead and starve. if she doesn't eat with me. then she doesn't eat at all. idiots! you can't talk to us like that. i forbid it. uh. oh. am i too late? shame, i was really going to tell him off this time. oh, master, you've returned. oh, very funny. i got you there. show me the girl. another petal fell. lumi re. i grew three more feathers. and i just plucked yesterday. i know, darling. i'm getting more metallic every day. oh, no. it's happening again. pardon me. oh, everyone, calm yourselves. we still have time. mama. am i ever going to be a boy again? oh, yes, chip. you'll have your days. in the sun again. you just leave it to me. i told you to go away. don't worry, dear. it's only mrs. potts. oh! oh, aren't you a vision! how lovely. to make your acquaintance. it's a very long journey. let me fix you up. before you go. i have found. that most troubles seem less troubling. after a bracing cup of tea. slowly now, chip. pleased to meet you. wanna see me do a trick? chip! that was a very brave thing you did for your father, dearie. yes. we all think so. i'm worried about him. he's never been on his own. cheer up, my poppet. things will turn out in the end. you'll feel a lot better. after dinner. but he said, if she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all. mmm, people say a lot of things in anger. it is our choice whether or not to listen. you coming, poppet? go! they are coming. final checks, everyone! tout de suite! no, you don't! if the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her he will blame me! yes, i will make sure of it. but did you see her stand up to him? i am telling you, this girl is the one. they must fall in love if we are to be human again. and how can they fall in love if she stays in her room? hey, chapeau, you missed a spot. you know she'll never love him. a broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami. but this is not one of those times. stand up straight! it's time to sparkle! mmm! i have no taste buds, but i can tell this is exquisite. off! off me while i work! pepper, get cracking! salt, shake a leg! not so loud! keep it down. of course, of course! but what is dinner. without a little music?

i don't understand why you're all being so kind to me. surely, you're as trapped here as i am. don't you ever want to escape? the master's not as terrible as he appears. somewhere deep in his soul, there's a prince. of a fellow who just waiting to be set free. lumi re mentioned something about the west wing. never you mind about that. off to bed with you, poppet. good night. nighty night. straight to bed. what are you doing here? what did you do to it? nothing. do you realize what you could have done? you could have damned us all! get out of here! go! checkmate. again. wait! no! you cheated again. mademoiselle, what are you doing?

that means we're getting very close to the castle. look, enough is enough. we have to turn back. stop! that's it! there it is! that's the tree! i'm sure of it. it was downed by lightning at the time. but now. it's resumed an upright position. through some sort of. magic or other. you really wanna marry into this family? so, that means. that the castle is that. no. no, it's. that way. definitely, that way. i am done playing this game of yours. where is belle? the beast took her and she. there are no such things as beasts. or talking teacups. or magic! but there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation. deep breaths, gaston. deep breaths. so, why don't we just turn around? go back to villeneuve. i'm sure belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner. if you think i've made all this up. then why did you offer to help? because i want to marry your daughter! now, let's go home. belle is not at home. she is with the. you say beast one more time. i will feed you to the wolves! gaston! stop it! breathe! think happy thoughts. go back to the war. blood. explosions. countless widows. widows. yes. yes. that's it. that's it. maurice! please, forgive me, old bean. that's no way to talk to my future father in law. now is it? future father in law? yeah! you will never marry my daughter. i saw that coming. if maurice won't give me his blessing. then he is in my way. once the wolves are finished with him. belle will have no one to take care of her but me. for the sake of exhausting all of our options. do we maybe wanna consider a slightly less. gruesome alternative? are you coming? yah! that hurts! if you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much. well, if you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened. well, if you hadn't frightened me, i wouldn't have run away. well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing. well, you should learn to control your temper! try to get some rest. thank you, miss. we are eternally grateful. why do you care about him so much? we've looked after him all his life. but he's cursed you somehow. why? you did nothing! you're quite right there, dear. you see, when the master lost his mother. and his cruel father took that sweet, innocent lad. and twisted him up to be just like him. we did nothing. let him sleep. days in the sun when my life has barely begun not until my whole life is done will i ever leave you will i tremble again to my dear one's gorgeous refrain will you now forever remain out of reach of my arms oh, those days in the sun what i'd give to relive just one 'night, mama. undo what's done and bring back the light oh, i could sing of the pain these dark days bring the spell we're under still it's the wonder of us i sing of tonight how in the midst of all this sorrow can so much hope and love endure i was innocent and certain now i'm wiser but unsure days in the past i can't go back into my childhood oh, those precious days couldn't last one that my father made secure i can feel a change in me oh, hold me closer i'm stronger now but still not free days in the sun will return we must believe as lovers do that days in the sun will come shining through what happens when the last petal falls? the master remains a beast forever. and we become. antiques. knick knacks. lightly used houseware. rubbish. we become rubbish. i want to help you. there must be some way to break the curse. well, there is one. it's not for you to worry about, lamb. we've made our bed and we must lie in it. drink. thank you, agathe. love can transpose to form and dignity. love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore. and therefore is winged cupid painted blind. you know shakespeare? i had an expensive education. actually, romeo and juliet's my favorite play. why is that not a surprise? i'm sorry? well, all that heartache and pining and. so many better things to read. like what? well, there are a couple of. things in here you could start with. are you all right? it's wonderful! yes. i suppose it is. well, if you like it so much, then it's yours. have you really read every one of these books? what? well, not all of them. some of them are in greek. was that a joke? are you making jokes now? maybe. the air is blue and keen and cold. and in a frozen sheath, enrolled. each branch, each twig. each blade of grass seems clad miraculously with. glass. i feel as if i'm seeing it for the first time. is there any more? um. but in that solemn silence is heard the whisper. of every sleeping thing. look. look at me. come wake me up. for still here i be. there's something sweet and almost kind but he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined and now he's dear and so unsure i wonder why i didn't see it there before she glanced this way i thought i saw and when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw no, it can't be i'll just ignore but then she's never looked at me that way before new, and a bit alarming who'd have ever thought that this could be true that he's no prince charming but there's something in him that i simply didn't see well, who'd have thought? well, bless my soul! well, who'd have known? well, who indeed? and who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own it's so peculiar wait and see we'll wait and see a few days more there may be something there that wasn't there before and here's a thought. perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before what, mama? there may be something there that wasn't there before what is it? what's there? i'll tell you when you're older. okay, i'm older! chip. you are a one. what are you reading? nothing. guinevere and lancelot. well, actually. king arthur and the round table. knights and men and swords and things. mmm. still. it's a romance. all right. i never thanked you for saving my life. well, i never thanked you. for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. they know how to have a good time. yes. but when i enter the room, laughter dies. me too. the villagers say that i'm a funny girl. but i'm not sure they mean it as a compliment. i'm sorry. your village sounds terrible. almost as lonely as your castle. what do you say we run away? another little gift from the enchantress. a book that truly allows you to escape. how amazing! it was her cruelest trick of all. it was just another curse. the outside world has no place for a creature like me. but it can for you. think of the one place you've always wanted to see. now find it in your mind's eye. then feel it in your heart. where did you take us? paris. oh, i love paris. what would you like to see first? notre dame. the champs lys es. no? too touristy? it's so much smaller than i imagined. this is the paris of my childhood these were the borders of my life in this crumbling, dusty attic where an artist loved his wife easy to remember harder to move on knowing the paris of my childhood is gone what happened to your mother? it was the one story papa could never bring himself to tell. i knew better than to ask. oh. a doctor's mask. plague. you must leave now. quickly. before it takes her too. i'm sorry i ever called your father a thief. let's go home. this is some storm, huh? at least we're not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere. surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves. you know it's not too late. we could always turn back. it's just. every time i close my eyes. i picture maurice stranded alone. and then when i open them. he's. maurice! gaston. did you try to kill maurice? maurice! thank heavens! i've spent the last five days. trying to find you. you tried to kill me. you left me to the wolves. wolves? it's one thing to rave about your delusions. it's another to accuse me of attempted murder. maurice. do you have any proof of what you're saying? ask agathe. she rescued me. agathe! you'd hang your accusations on the testimony. of a filthy hag? no offense, agathe. monsieur lefou. he was there. he saw it all. me? you're right. don't take my word for it. lefou. my dearest companion. did i. your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot. try to kill the father of the only woman i've ever loved? well, it's a complicated question on a number of accounts. but no. no, he did not. you. maurice. it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others. no wonder belle ran away. you need help, sir. a place to heal your troubled mind. everything's going to be fine. just fine. well, i saw her in the ballroom. and said, you're making everything look so beautiful. we should have a dance tonight. i never imagined she'd actually say yes. what was i thinking? no, master. it's perfect. the rose has only four petals left which means tonight. you can tell her how you feel. i feel like a fool. she will never love me. do not be discouraged. she is the one. i wish you'd stop saying that! there is no one. you care for her, don't you? well, then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight. yes, and when the moment's just right. well, how will i know? you will feel slightly nauseous. don't worry, master. you'll do fine. just stop being so nervous and tell belle how you feel. because if you don't. i promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days! in the dark. covered in dust. dark and very, very dusty. start with the hair. women love nice hair! i'll take the fingers and toes. chapeau, brush those teeth. they need it. dip, dip. snip, snip. polish the nails. shine the horns. eyes closed. poof, poof. and to top it all off. voil ! okay, i can fix this. oh! beautiful! but something is missing. oh, yes. the finishing touch. tale as old as time true as it can be barely even friends then somebody bends unexpectedly just a little change small to say the least both a little scared neither one prepared beauty and the beast ever just the same ever a surprise ever as before ever just as sure as the sun will rise tale as old as time tune as old as song bittersweet and strange finding you can change learning you were wrong certain as the sun rising in the east tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast i haven't danced in years. i'd almost forgotten the feeling. it's foolish, i suppose. for a creature like me to hope. that one day he might earn your affection. i don't know. really? you think you could be happy here? can anybody be happy if they aren't free? my father taught me to dance. i used to step on his toes a lot. you must miss him. very much. would you like to see him? i'd like to see my father. papa! what are they doing to him? he's in trouble! then you must go to him. what did you say? you must go to him. no time to waste. no. you keep it with you. then you'll always have a way to look back on me. thank you. oh. well, master, i have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork. true love really does win the day! i let her go. you what? master, how could you do that? i had to. but why? because he loves her. then why are we not human? because she doesn't love him. and now, it's too late. but she might still come back. no. i set her free. i'm sorry i couldn't do the same for all of you. now, go. our time is almost past. come, my love. i was the one who had it all i was the master of my fate i never needed anybody in my life i learned the truth too late i'll never shake away the pain i close my eyes but she's still there i let her steal into my melancholy heart it's more than i can bear now i know she'll never leave me even as she runs away she will still torment me calm me, hurt me move me, come what may wasting in my lonely tower waiting by an open door i'll fool myself she'll walk right in and be with me for evermore i rage against the trials of love i curse the fading of the light though she's already flown so far beyond my reach she's never out of sight now i know she'll never leave me even as she fades from view she will still inspire me be a part of everything i do wasting in my lonely tower waiting by an open door i'll fool myself she'll walk right in and as the long, long nights begin i'll think of all that might have been waiting here for evermore this man is weak. please! he needs a hospital. not an asylum! have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, maurice? you wouldn't last a week. just give me your daughter's hand, and i'll set you free. never. take him away! stop! papa. oh, belle. i thought i'd lost you. let him out! he's hurt. we can't do that, miss. but we'll take very good care of him. my father's not crazy. gaston, tell him! you know how loyal i am to your family. but your father's been making some unbelievable claims. it's true, belle. he's been raving about a beast. in a castle! i've just come from the castle and there is a beast! you'd say anything to set him free. your word is hardly proof. you want proof? show me the beast! there's your proof. this is sorcery! look at this beast! look at his fangs! his claws! no. don't be afraid. he's gentle and kind. the monster has her under his spell. if i didn't know better, i'd say she even cared for him! he's not a monster, gaston. you are! the beast wouldn't hurt anyone. i've heard of the effects of dark magic. but i've never before seen it with my own eyes! this is a threat to our very existence! we can't have her running off to warn the beast. lock her up too. no! come here! shut up! you won't get away with this, gaston! oh, belle! gaston, with all due respect. do you want to be next? fetch my horse. stand guard! don't let them escape. this creature will curse us all if we don't stop him. well, i say, we kill the beast! kill the beast! we're not safe until he's dead he'll come stalking us at night set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite he'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free so it's time to take some action, boys it's time to follow me through the mist, through the wood through the darkness and the shadows it's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle and there's something truly terrible inside it's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones massive paws, killer claws for the feast hear him roar, see him foam but we're not coming home 'til he's dead good and dead kill the beast! light your torch, mount your horse screw your courage to the sticking place we're counting on gaston to lead the way call it war, call it threat you can bet they all will follow for in times like this they'll do just as i say there's a beast running wild there's no question but i fear the wrong monster's released sally forth, tally ho grab your sword, grab your bow praise the lord, and here we go show me the castle. at least he has finally learned to love. a lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return. no. this is the first time i've had any real hope she would. did you hear that, mama? is it her? is she coming back? could it be? i told you! sacr bleu! invaders! ruffians! well, there you go. so much for true love. man the barricades. and hold fast! move aside! hearts ablaze, banners high we go marching into battle unafraid, although the danger's just increased raise the flag, sing the song here we come, we're fifty strong and fifty frenchmen can't be wrong let's kill the beast! we need help. i have to warn the beast. warn him? how did you get away from him? he let me go, papa. he sent me back to you. i don't understand. where did you. he took me there. i know what happened to maman. then you know why i had to leave her there. i had to protect you. i've always tried to protect my little girl. probably too much. i understand. will you help me now? it's dangerous. yes. yes, it is. i could try to pick the lock. after all. it's only gears and springs. but i would need. something long and sharp. like that. perfect. oh, excuse me, master. i'm so sorry to disturb you. she's not coming back. no. they're breaking down the doors! doesn't matter now. just let them come. kill the beast! kill the beast! this isn't working! i know what to do. kill the beast! kill the beast! kill the beast! are you not the least bit concerned. that this castle might be haunted?
