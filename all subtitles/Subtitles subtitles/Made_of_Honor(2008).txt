'that's so colin'. right. and then, maybe you could get some. information from colin. and emphasize their unique bond, their shared history. off course. we could talk about love at first sight. well, that's always a crowd pleaser, but. hannah. elaborate. tell me more about him. how you feel about him. where did you meet? in scotland. modigliani. your first summer in new york city, you were dating a guy who worked on wall street. and he asked you to move in. with him and you weren't quite sure. and it was right around that time. that you 'discovered' modigliani. and became obsessed with this painting. of this woman who had this blue scarf on, holding a baby. and hannah said 'that. painting captured the essence. of that woman better than any photograph'. i can't believe you can remember that. i also remembered that she. freaked, because she said she felt more. passionate about that painting. than she did but 'mr. wall street'. and she wondered if she could ever meet somebody. that could make her feel this. passionate as that work of art. that's good. that's good. modigliani. now i know why you picked him to be 'maid of honor'. yes. come on. who's ready to lose some. money tonight. because i'm feeling lucky. you guys are late. how you doing? how you holding up, champ? stressed. what the hell is this? hannah's shower's in the morning. well where are we gonna play? we're not gonna play until these baskets get done, and everything else gets done. what about this party mix? that's 'pot pourri'. this is perfect. come on felix, take that off. have you ever had one of these? that's funny. you can't even see. you'll have to, to sleep with you. take this. you could be like blinded. no, i'm not playing with baskets. it's poker night. you put 'bayberry' with 'serenity'. you don't like? no, it's interesting. just thought it was obvious that. 'bayberry' worked best with 'harmony'. really? i've been putting 'bayberry'. with 'tahitian sunrise'. that i like. that's zen. yeah. you know what i like? i like how. you put the bat ball right in the center. i like that so much that i'm gonna. see you ball and raise you another ball. that's a good idea. we should definitely have balls. yeah. do another ball. hey, dennis. come and curl some ribbon. i can feel my sperm dying inside. of me, one at a time. shut up and grab a basket. come on, it's fun. i'm going to a strip club to eat some meat. then i'm gonna get into a fight. call me when you find your balls, tom. alright, tuff guy. or maybe they're in the basket, next to the 'tahitian sunrise'. someone's afraid of his feminine side. look at that. nice job with the fluffing. look at that. perfect. perfect. what is that, my friends. look at us. come on. can't lose. good work, huh? hello ladies. you look lovely today. tom. oh, hillary. how are you? good. everything looks wonderful. this is the best shower i've ever been to. really? you think so? you know what, hillary? you should really eat something. no, tom. i'm fine. fine. i'm okay. what you ladies would go. through to fit in to a dress. this pretty much blows your rule out of. the water about no women allowed at your place. what good is a rule if you. don't break it every now and then? i'm very, very impressed thank you. listen to that. gay gordon's party remix, just for you. hear the horn. it's good isn't it? no. let me turn it up there. it's. it's a little loud. what? it's a little loud. okay. there you go. look at this. try this. haggis pink. it's pepper, cheese, chopped up baby. lamb lung, and cow pituitary gland. how are you? . it's a scottish delicacy. colin recommended it. ladies, ladies. look. what just came, for hannah. it's from colin, everyone. oh wait. there's a card. there's a card, a card. for 'hannah'. 'hannah, my love, this is the extremely. rare scottish floral bud thistle'. thistle? 'they only bloom for hours before they die'. he must have timed this out perfectly. oh my gosh, when we first met, colin promised that he would roam. at the countryside to find me one, and he did. sweetheart, that's the most romantic. thing i ever heard. thanks mom. joan, good to see you. it's been too long. easter, wasn't it?

the gay gordon, pink haggis, dildo sales woman? just understand something, melissa set me up. oh please. there's always an excuse with you. i never even should have asked. you to do this in the first place. you don't even believe in marriage. for christ sake. you know, i might. i gotta get back. melissa's pretty good. look, the whole goal here was to. convince hannah that i've grown up, and that she doesn't know anything about colin. that i'm the right man for her. that did not happen. stella. no, baby. don't eat buttons, okay? yeah, but your still the maid of honor, right tom? i don't know. i think she might have fired me. how does somebody. get fired from being maid of honor? tell me about it. you know what? i got an idea. okay. to prove to hannah that you're the only man for her, we have to make you the best made of honor, ever. right. i'm out of loss. completely stunned. great. my guy couldn't find any dirt on colin. this has never happened. this guy's clean. glad that happened to me. you know, he's got guinness world records? cool. we don't need to know that. he's actually got a medal of honor. that's funny, because we got the made of honor. let's stay focused. look, the point is, we're not gonna. get her off this guy. yeah, so we need to make this not about colin. yeah, we need to make it about you. good. you gotta show her that you're growing up. finally. i am changing. i am growing up. good. then this should be easy for you. great. these are bridal magazines from. different countries. each with a feature article on. the duties of being the maid of honor. perfect.' ber bride'. i got these guys in bangalore that we're. outsource to, they translated them over night. great. nice 'appetizers' there, gary. here's the 'main course' what have you got for me?
