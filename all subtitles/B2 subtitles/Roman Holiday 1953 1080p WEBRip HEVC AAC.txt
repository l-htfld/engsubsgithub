yes, sir. very well. now we must notify their majesties. so happy. the pleasure's mine. screwball. holy smoke. the princess interview. . hi, joe. good morning, joe. hello, honey. mr. hennessy has been looking for you. thanks a lot, hon. come in! you been looking for me? just coming to work? who, me? we start our days at in this office. we pick up our assignments. i picked mine up last night. what assignment was that? the princess, . you've already been to the interview? sure. i just got back. well, well, well. all my apologies. it's all right. very interesting. just routine. she answered the questions on the list? well, of course she did. i've got them right here somewhere. don't disturb yourself. i have a copy here. how did her highness react to the idea of a european federation? she thought it was just fine. she did? well, she thought there would be two effects. two. the direct and the indirect. remarkable. naturally, she thought that the indirect would not be as direct. as the direct. at least not right away. later on, of course, well, nobody knows. well, well, well. that was a shrewd observation. they fool you, these royal kids. they've got a lot more on the ball than we suspect. how did she feel about the future friendship of nations? youth. she felt that the youth of the world. must. lead the way. to a better. world. original. by the way, what was she wearing? you mean what did she have on? well, that's usually what it means. what's the matter? little warm for you? no, i just hurried over here. naturally, with a story of these dimensions. did you say she was wearing gray? no, i didn't say that. well, she usually wears gray. well, it was a kind of a gray. i think i know the dress you mean. it has a gold collar. that's the one. i didn't know exactly how to describe it, but that's it. i think you described it very well. in view of the fact that her highness was taken violently ill at a.m. put to bed with a high fever. and has had all her appointments for today canceled in toto! in toto? yes, mr. bradley. in toto. that's certainly pretty hard to swallow. in view of the fact that you just left her, of course. but here it is, all over the front page of every newspaper in rome. all right, all right, i overslept. it could happen to anybody. if you ever got up early enough to read a morning paper. you might discover little news events. little items of general interest. that might prevent you in the future from getting immersed. in such a gold plated, triple decked, star spangled lie as you just told me. if i were you, i'd try some other line of business, like mattress testing. is this the princess? yes, mr. bradley, that is the princess. it isn't annie oakley, dorothy amour or madame chang kai shek. take a good look at her. you might be interviewing her again someday. am i fired? no, you're not fired. when i want to fire you, you won't have to ask. you'll know you're fired. the man's mad. giovanni, it's joe bradley. now listen carefully. i want you to hurry up to my place and see if there's somebody there asleep. si , mr. joe. i look. subito . you wait. aspetta . mr. joe? yeah. yeah, yeah. tell me, tell me. giovanni, i love you. now, listen. yes, mr. joe. a gun? no! yes, a gun, a knife, anything! but nobody goes in, and nobody goes out. okay. you still here? how much would a real interview with this dame be worth? you mean her highness? i don't mean annie oakley, dorothy amour or madame. how much? what do you care? you got as much chance. i know, but if i did, how much would it be worth? just a plain talk on world conditions might be worth . her views on clothes, of course, would be worth a lot more. maybe a thousand. dollars? dollars. i'm talking about her views on everything. the private and secret longings. of a princess. her innermost thoughts, as revealed to your rome correspondent. in a private, personal. exclusive. interview. can't use it? i didn't think you'd like it. come here. love angle too, i suppose. practically all love angle. with pictures. could be. how much? that particular story would be worth five grand to any news service. but tell me, mr. bradley, if you are sober. just how you are going to obtain this fantastic interview. i plan to enter her sick room disguised as a thermometer. you said five grand? i want you to shake on that. you realize her highness is in bed today and leaves for athens tomorrow. i'd like to make a little side bet with you. five hundred says you don't come up with the story. what are you looking at that for? i just want to see what time it is. what day it is. it's a deal. now i'd like you to shake. you're into me for about now. when you lose this bet, you'll owe me a thousand. why, you poor sucker. i'll practically own you. you have practically owned me for a couple of years, but that's all over. i'm gonna win that money, and i'm gonna buy a one way ticket back to new york. go on. i love to hear you whine. and when i'm back in a real newsroom, i'll enjoy thinking about you. sitting here with an empty leash in your hands and nobody to twitch for you. so long, pigeon. everything okay, giovanni? si , signore joe. nobody she's come, nobody she's go. absolutely nobody. swell. thanks a lot. how would you like to make some money? that's the stuff. i've got a sure thing. double your money back in two days. double my money? well, i need a little investment capital to swing the deal. now, if you'll just lend me a little cash. you. owing me two months rent. and you want me to lend you money? tomorrow you'll be sorry. your highness? your royal highness? yes? what is it? dear doctor bonnachoven. sure, yes. well, you're fine. much better. is there anything you want? so many things. yes? well, tell the doctor. tell the good doctor everything. i dreamt and i dreamt. yes? well, what did you dream? i dreamt i was asleep in the street. and a young man came. he was tall and strong. and he was so mean to me. he was? it was wonderful. good morning. where's doctor bonnachoven? i'm afraid i don't know anybody by that name. wasn't i talking to him just now? afraid not. have i had an accident? quite safe for me to sit up? perfectly. thank you. are these yours? did you lose something? would you be so kind as to tell me. where i am? well, this is what is laughingly known as my apartment. did you bring me here by force? quite the contrary. have i been here all night. alone? if you don't count me, yes. so i've spent the night here. with you. well, now, i don't know that i'd use those words exactly. but. from a certain angle. yes. how do you do?

tell the doctor? anyway, the chances of it being granted are very slight. well, what now? i've heard of a wonderful place for dancing on a boat. the barges down by sant'angelo. yes. couldn't we go there tonight?
