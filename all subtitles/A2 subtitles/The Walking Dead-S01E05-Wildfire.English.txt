 i don't know if you can hear me. maybe you're listening right now. i hope so. i found others my family, if you can believe it. static my wife and son, they're alive. i wanted you to know that. there's something else you need to know. atlanta isn't what we thought. it's not what they promised. the city is do not enter the city. it belongs to the dead now. we're camped a few miles northwest, up by a big abandoned rock quarry. you can see it on a map. i hope you come find us. but be careful. last night walkers came out of the woods. we lost people. watch yourself, morgan. take care of your boy. i'll try you again tomorrow at dawn. static andrea. i'm so sorry. she's gone. you got to let us take her. we all cared about her and i promise we'll be as gentle as we can. grunts coughing she still won't move? lori won't even talk to us. she's been there all night. what do we do? can't just leave amy like that. we need to deal with it same as the others. i'll tell her how it is. andrea. cocks i know how the safety works. all right. okay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. theme music playing daryl y'all can't be serious. let that girl hamstring us? the dead girl's a time bomb. rick what do you suggest? take the shot. clean, in the brain from here. hell, i can hit a turkey between the eyes from this distance. no. for god's sakes, let her be. scoffs wake up, jimbo. we've got some work to do. panting morales thanks. thanks. what are you guys doing? this is for geeks. our people go over there. daryl what's the difference? they're all infected. glenn our people go in that row over there. we don't burn them! we bury them. understand? our people go in that row over there. you reap what you sow. morales you know what? shut up, man. y'all left my brother for dead. you had this coming. are you bleeding? i just got some on me from the bodies. that blood is fresh. were you bit? jim no. i got scratched during the attack. you got bit. i'm fine. then show me. whispers don't tell, please. a walker got him. a walker bit jim. jim i'm okay. i'm okay. show it to us. show it to us. chattering shane easy, jim. daryl grab him. jim, put it down. put it down. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay. breathing heavily i'm okay. i say we put a pickaxe in his head and the dead girl's and be done with it. is that what you'd want if it were you? yeah, and i'd thank you while you did it. i hate to say it i never thought i would but maybe daryl's right. jim's not a monster, dale, or some rabid dog. i'm not suggesting he's sick. a sick man. we start down that road, where do we draw the line? the line's pretty clear. zero tolerance for walkers, or them to be. what if we can get him help? i heard the cdc was working on a cure. i heard that too. heard a lot of things before the world went to hell. what if the cdc is still up and running? man, that is a stretch right there. rick why? if there's any government left, any structure at all, they'd protect the cdc at all costs, wouldn't they? i think it's our best shot. shelter, protection okay, rick, you want those things, all right? i do too, okay? now if they exist, they're at the army base. fort benning. that's miles in the opposite direction. that is right. but it's away from the hot zone. now listen to me. if that place is operational, it'll be heavily armed. we'd be safe there. rick the military were on the front lines of this thing. they got overrun. we've all seen that. the cdc is our best choice and jim's only chance. you go looking for aspirin, do what you need to do. someone needs to have some balls to take care of this damn problem! hey hey hey! we don't kill the living. that's funny coming from a man who just put a gun to my head. we may disagree on some things, not on this. you put it down. go on. come with me. where are you taking me? somewhere safe. i came to pay my respects. did i ever mention how i lost my wife? cancer, wasn't it? yeah. i dragged her to every doctor, every test. and after all the surgeries and the chemos, she was ready. she accepted it, you know? but i never could. and i spent the last few years so angry. i felt so cheated. since she passed, you girls were the first people. that i cared anything for. this is her birthday? her birthday was always like like a week long affair. but i somehow always missed it. i was away at college or too busy for kid's parties. she'd call all excited. i always said that i'd make it home and i really always meant to, but i never made it past that phone call. i know things are hard enough for you without adding guilt into the mix, huh? head squishes i'll do it. he's my husband. crying groans grunting sobbing shallow breathing breathing amy. amy, i'm sorry. i'm sorry for not ever being there. i always thought there'd be more time. growling i'm here now, amy. i'm here. i love you. gunshot say it. okay. i'm thinking if you'd have stayed here, if you'd have looked after your own instead you went off. you took half our manpower with you. i'm thinking maybe our losses wouldn't have been so bad. if we hadn't gone off and brought those guns back when we did, i think our losses would have been a lot worse. maybe the entire camp. truck approaching exhales i still think it's a mistake not burning these bodies. it's what we said we'd do, right? burn em all, wasn't that the idea? shane at first. the chinaman gets all emotional, says it's not the thing to do, we just follow him along? these people need to know who the hell's in charge here, what the rules are. there are no rules. lori well, that's a problem. we haven't had one minute to hold onto anything of our old selves. we need time to mourn and we need to bury our dead. it's what people do. oh no. no no no no. no, not this, please. groans panting zombies growling no no no. oh, no no no. no no. people scream panting crying i can do it. i can do it. i can do it! i can do it. crying dale hey. panting burying other people is bad enough, but the thought of one of us lori shh. are we safe now, dad? now that we're together? i won't leave again. i promise you that. not for anything. now give me a chance to discuss some things with your mom, okay? yeah. rick all right. all right. shane blames me for not being here. do you? we got guns now. we're stronger. and we have fewer people. that makes us weaker. you want me to say i think you were right? i understand that. all i can say is that neither one of you is entirely wrong. it's the best i can do right now. what about the cdc? rick we're at the ragged edge here. we need relief and we got a sick man who needs help. i don't know why people can't see that. well, look at their faces. look at mine. we're all terrified. if one of us suggested, based on a hunch, that we head toward that city, you'd have no part of it. tell me something with certainty. i love you. that's that's all that's all i got. i love you too. door opens knocks his fever is worse. you need anything? uh. water. could use more water. lori i'll get some. okay. lori carol, you help me? you save a grave for me? nobody wants that. jim it's not about what you want. that, uh that sound you hear, that's god laughing while you make plans. what i want, jim, if if god allows, is to get you some help. groans coughing spits groans, inhales deeply coughs watch the mangroves. their roots will gouge the whole boat. you know that, right? amy is there swimming. you'll watch the boat, right? you said you would. i'll watch the boat. don't worry. okay. i need you to help talk some sense into rick. look, this cdc thing, lori, it's a mistake. so you're backing him? what else would i do? he's my husband. look, it may be time for you to play the dutiful wife, but you can't tell me that fixing your marriage is worth putting people's lives at risk. i think folks around here can make up their minds without bringing my marriage into it. it's a habit you need to break. i guess i'll just add it to the list of habits that i'm breaking whether i like it or not. what habits? just talking about my need for a plan, man. so what is it? are we leaving or not? maybe y'all just want to stay here. we could hang some more tin cans. we can't stay here. we both know that. i was just telling shane i think we should trust your gut. let's go do our sweep. shane tell you what, man, these people, man, they're not convinced. you know? you head to the cdc, you might be on your own. you gotta really consider whether you want to put lori and carl in that kind of spot. i got to do what's best for my family. best for your family? what's that? exposing them to all kinds of risks? as opposed to what? crossing miles of hostile territory? if we're looking for a lifeline, i say swim toward the closest ship, not further out to sea. why can't you back me up? shane look, i want to. it's just. i don't see it. if it was your family, you'd feel differently. what did you say to me? i kept em safe, man. i looked after them like they were no, they were my own. that's what i did, rick. shane, i didn't mean it that way. well, how'd you mean it? go on, man. how'd you mean it? sighs you're misinterpreting me, man. all right. you're just hearing it wrong. yeah? look, you know you know i can never repay that debt, okay? branch snaps jesus. chuckles i know. gonna have to start wearing reflective vests out here. seriously. come on, man. come on, man, let's go. nothing out here. shane i've, uh i've been thinking about rick's plan. now look, there are no there are no guarantees either way. i'll be the first one to admit that. i've known this man a long time. i trust his instincts. i say the most important thing here is we need to stay together. so those of you that agree, we leave first thing in the morning. okay? walkie talkie squawks we're moving out, leaving the quarry. if you heard me yesterday, you may be coming here. if you are, we'll be gone by the time you arrive. i'm leaving a note and map behind for you taped to a red car so you can follow our trail. we're heading to the cdc. if there's anything left, it's got to be there, don't you think? morgan. i hope you were right about that place. i need you to be. gasps muffled talking coughs shane everybody listen up. those of you with cbs, we're gonna be on channel . let's keep the chatter down, okay? now you got a problem, don't have a cb, can't get a signal or anything at all, you're gonna hit your horn one time. that'll stop the caravan. any questions? morales we're, uh we're not going. woman we have family in birmingham. we want to be with our people. you go on your own, you won't have anyone to watch your back. morales we'll take the chance. i got to do what's best for my family. you sure?

he seems to be. i would say yes. dale back in the camp when i said daryl might be right and you shut me down, you misunderstood. i would never go along with callously killing a man. i was just gonna suggest that we ask jim what he wants. and i think we have an answer. shane we just leave him here? we take off? man, i'm not sure i could live with that. lori it's not your call, either one of you. rick yeah. that's it. jim groans breathing heavily hey, another damn tree. chuckles hey, jim i mean, you know it doesn't need to be this. no. it's good. the breeze feels nice. okay. all right. just close your eyes, sweetie. don't fight. jim, do you want this?
