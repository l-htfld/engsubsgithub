yeah. what? this is some bull! it's sad. news, for sure. now, you're all valued employees. but as we undergo this transition to life online. we wanted to be candid with you. that some of you will be determined non vital employees. to the new partnership. and we'll be deciding which of those positions. will be remaining with us over the course of the next week. also, we feel sad about that, as you can see. now for some good news. we are very excited. all right, don. ted hendricks. managing director of the transition. never fun, this stage. but we do have ahead of us the privilege of publishing. what will be the very last issue of life magazine. and for the final issue, we just received a telegram. come on. from sean o'connell. who has never, i'm told, been willing. to speak with the executives here. well, he broke his long silence and shared his thoughts with us. through that old man. sean o'connell. i expect full consideration of negative for cover. my most grand. the quintessence of life. what is that? it means like the fullest and most rich. okay. so our cover will probably be the most famous ever. because it really will have the big quintessence of all time. very full and so rich. so let's see this thing. huh?
