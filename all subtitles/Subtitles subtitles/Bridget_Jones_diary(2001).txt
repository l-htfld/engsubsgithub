from the home shopping channel. comes into the store to have his colors done. potential for what? as a demonstrator on his cable show. you know, his assistant. apparently, it's the highest rated show on the channel. well, apart from the one. where the fat people beat up their relatives. ooh! i must wiz. have you heard from mark darcy? goodbye, mum. the dramatics singing mrs. mrs. jones mum julian. sorry to keep you waiting. the dramatics singing goin' on and on and on and on bridget and a few weeks later, it got lots worse. hello! look at this. julian paying off this heart shaped pendant. one of my own personal recommendations. is this absolutely stunning. matching necklace and earring set. julian the earrings measuring just over a centimeter. in genuine diamond with two pairs in lapis lazuli. in a lovely mock gold finish. julian the exact replica of those worn at wimbledon. in by her royal highness the duchess of kent. turns off sound well. has she actually moved out then? apparently, she and this tangerine tinted buffoon. are suddenly an item. half our friends have had them around to bloody dinner. dad she's even taking jaundice julian. to una alconbury's tarts and vicars party. that's not the pamela i knew. that's cruel. bridget well, still, could be a golden opportunity. if you spent the entire party flirting with other women. it would drive mum wild with jealousy. dad what? bridget that's how i got my man. have you got a boyfriend? a real one? i have, father. i have. and he's perfect. car horn honking revs engine bridget hurrah. am no longer tragic spinster. but proper girlfriend of bonafide a sex god. so committed that he's taking me. on a full blown mini break holiday weekend. daniel just promise me we don't have to sit. in any little boats and read poncey poetry to each other. bridget he's also protecting me at uncle geoffrey's. hideous tarts and vicars fancy dress party. this can't be just shagging. a mini break means true love. suddenly feel like screen goddess. in manner of grace kelly. though perhaps ever so slightly less elegant under pressure. it's very quiet here, isn't it? are we the only guests, or. we have a wedding this weekend. i believe there are just four of you not involved. oh. hmm. natasha you do the boats, i'll do the tea. oh, jesus. hello there. hi. mark well, well. i take it you're also heading for the alconbury's rockery. yes, that's right. i brought natasha. get a bit of work done. thought i might make it a not entirely wasted weekend. how interesting. what a gripping life you do lead. daniel i'll see you upstairs in a second. hmm. well, the weakness of their case. lies in the deposition they made on august . bridget season of mist. and. mellow fruitlessness. oh, fuck me, i love keats. have you heard this one? there was a young woman from ealing. who had a peculiar feeling. she lay on her back and opened her crack. and pissed all over the ceiling. bang oh, bollocks. bridget what've you done? i'm boarding you, bridge. don't you dare! i'm king of the world! no! fuck me. uhh! bridget aah! bridget laughs daniel oh, piss and bollocks. you stupid ass. laughing bollocks. all right. aah! no! so childish. bridget aah! no! yes. daniel hey, darce, come on in! the water's lovely! come on, you're working too hard, mate. ha ha! daniel. yes, bridget?

because you don't have the faintest bloody idea. of just how much trouble the company's in. you swan in in your short skirt. and your sexy see through blouse. and fanny around with press releases. you know, this is the americans flying in. because they're thinking of shutting us down. for fuck's sake. sorry. i'm sorry, bridge. i know i'm being a prat. look, i'm going to arrange a lovely car. to come and pick you up and take you back. to london after the party, ok? if you have to travel alone, travel in style. hmm. and, um. i also think it's very important. that you win this costume competition. good. good start. now, then, miss jones, where does this go? bridget oh, well, here we go. trying hard to fight off a vision. of mum and auntie una in fishnet tights. seems unnatural, wrong even, for year olds to dress up. as prostitutes and priests on a sunday afternoon. people chattering laughter julie london singing fly me to the moon bridget oh, holy jesus. bridget. where are all the other tarts and vicars? una oh, dear. didn't geoffrey call you? didn't you telephone colin and bridget? how's my little bridget? geoffrey bop, bop. oh. geoffrey. so, where's this chap of yours, then, eh? ah, yes, well, he had to work, so. ha! a likely tale. off they run. whee! laughs weakly julie london singing you are all i long for bizarre what some men find attractive. oh, god. mum darling! geoffrey! what on earth are you wearing? you look like a common prostitute. yes, well, that was, actually, the point. say hi to julian. hello, julian. my dear. you and your mother could be sisters. julian and what a lovely bracelet. it's what i call an all arounder the sort of thing one can wear with anything to any occasion. oh. have you spoken to my dad?

david? darren? mark daniel cleaver. oh. is he a friend of yours, mark? absolutely not. i hope he's good enough for our little bridget. i think i can say with total confidence absolutely not. well, i'm sure he'd say the same about you. given your past behavior. sorry? i think you know what i mean. mark. bridget hmm. looks like auntie shirley. didn't get the message, either. doorbell rings hi. i really, really wanted to see a friendly face. oh, now, listen, i'll tell you what. i have an idea. let me finish this. while you go home, have a long hot bath. and i'll call round, and we'll have dinner later, ok? door closes is there someone here? not that i'm aware of. unless that bosnian family has moved in again. bastards. laughs oh. i'm sorry. sorry. i'm going mad. listen, i am feeling really bad, actually. i should've been there today. no, i'm sorry. no, no, i'm sorry. but at least i got a hell of a lot of work done. just give me one more hour, ok? fine. that's fine. i will go home and de bunny. oh. and you know last night when i said that i loved you? mm hmm. i didn't mean it. i was being ironic. oh, god, yeah, i know, i know. all right. thank you, madam. mmm. drops bag bridge. bridget. this is lara from the new york office. lara, this is bridget. hey, there. lara i thought you said she was thin. alex i was hoping that you would want to be a part of it. bridget sniffles dan this is totally insane. i'm years old. it may be my last chance to have a child. alex. aah! narrator the male penetrates the female and leaves. coitus is brief and perfunctory. and the female. continues indistinctly that's wonderful. daniel well, i don't think it's bad. daniel right. bridget we've had very good response. to the teddy knows best teaser campaign and had various local radio bits for look, bridge, stop that. daniel i feel.terrible. the thing is. with lara and me. well, you know. no. you'll have to fill me in. well, the truth is. the truth is, we're the same, bridge, you and me. you know? we're two people of a certain age. looking for the moment to commit and finding it really hard. and i just think that in the end. it's got to be something extraordinary. something which makes us go that extra mile. and i think. lara and i don't know, being american and all. it has something to do with confidence and being so. well, young, you know? well, we've.become very close. well, you've only just met her. she flew in yesterday. uh. oh. silly bridget. you haven't only just met her. daniel no. no. i got to know her pretty well. when we were in the new york office together. oh. oh, fuck. there's no easy way to say this, but, um. i wanted you to be the first to know that. we're engaged. bridget at times like this. continuing with one's life seems impossible. and eating the entire contents of one's fridge. seems inevitable. i have two choices to give up and accept permanent state of spinster hood. and eventual eating by dogs. or not. sighs and this time, i choose not. i will not be defeated. by a bad man and an american stick insect. instead, i choose vodka. and chakakhan. disco music playing chakakhan singing i'm every woman it's all in me anything you want done, baby i'll do it naturally mmm i'm every woman it's all in me i can be the most right now every girl from a to z whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa whoa ahh. ohh! chakakahn singing i can cast a spell fuck. chakakahn singing of secrets you can't tell mix a special groove put fire inside of you any time you feel danger. why do you want to be in television? well, i've realized that i've become deeply committed. to communicating to the public. the up to the moment and in depth news. both political and ecological. what do you think of the el ni o phenomenon? bridget um.it's ab lip. i think, basically, latin music is on its way out. so, why do you want to work in television? because i'm passionately committed. to communicating with children. they are the future. do you have any children of your own?
