 i got a better idea. why don't you get in the truck and drive away? not without her, i don't. that a ls mm taggart? yeah. so, what? you'd be better off throwin' that thing at me. why don't you shut up? or what? you gonna shoot me? yeah. that's far enough. you're gonna need more than one bullet to stop me. put my mind to it, i don't need a gun to stop you. hey. let's everybody just calm down, okay? if somebody's sick, i wanna go and help. mel, we're not. no, i'm only going with jack. boss doesn't like visitors. yeah, well, i don't like guns being waved in my face. we can stand around threatening each other, or we can go. get in the truck. hell's bells, what's going on in here? only me and brady are working the front of the house tonight. nobody answering the phone? yeah, sorry. we're kind of slammed right now. well, i was calling to get the specials. no specials. well, then i'll take the meatloaf. to go. where's jack? uh, he and mel blew a tire on the way to myrtle farms. they don't have a spare. good god, i'll drive out and pick 'em up. no. you just got out of the hospital. i passed my stress test. i am free to resume my regular activities. well, meddlin' in other people's business is not an activity. it is an annoyance. i'll drive that spare up there myself. not necessary. jack already ordered a tow truck. oh, well, then i guess we don't have a problem. he said it'd take a while. where's preacher? uh, he's, uh, in west virginia. his parents' basement flooded or something. he's gonna be back in a couple days. what are you doing? pitching in. but don't worry, you can still take your meatloaf to go. i figure i'll. i'll eat it here. there's a table for one in the corner. here. hi. has anyone heard from jack? my calls are going straight to voice mail. he and mel got a flat on the way to myrtle farms. oh. what. what are they doing out there? who knows? but the tow truck's on its way. okay. hey. i'll just wait here, then. might be a while. i don't mind. can i have a white zinfandel? you can, but why would you want to? because it's delicious. jimmy's back. all right. stay here. where are we? this is an illegal growers' camp. where's the pot? they grow it underground in shipping containers. the police don't do anything? well, they would, but most grows like this one are actually inside state parks. falls under the department of fish and wildlife. there's just not enough wardens to patrol all the land. we just try to stay clear of 'em. i'm so sorry. i didn't mean to get you into this. well, the other option was to watch you drive away with a gun toting maniac, so. listen, we're just gonna go in there, you'll take care of whoever needs help, and then we'll be on our way, okay? all right. yeah. just breathe. oh, i thought i was breathing. look, i'm not gonna let anything happen to you. come on. let's go. no, not you. where she goes, i go. who are you? i'm mel. i'm a nurse. i told you idiots to bring doc. it wasn't me. it was jimmy. come on, jimmy. what the hell? i went to get doc. i got her instead. ow. ow! what's he doing here? she wouldn't come without him. get them out of here. the bullet went through, and there's a clear exit wound. it looks like a . hollow point. you know your guns. no, i know my bullets. i need a tourniquet. oh. here. listen, you lost a lot of blood. you need to go to a hospital. gunshot wounds get reported to the police. well, you need a surgeon. won't this stop the bleeding? this is a temporary fix. look, just fix me up, then you can leave. i don't have any supplies. i don't have any equipment. i can't. take them to the provisions shack. yep. let's go. follow me. okay. you need to push pressure on this. hurry up. make it snappy. where do they get all this stuff? well, i think doc leaves whatever he can behind. how often is he here? once or twice a month. look, that bullet could have nicked an artery. you're just gonna do whatever you can, and then we're gonna go, okay? i can't guarantee he's not gonna die. clear? okay. whoa, i need those menus. uh, yeah. okay. yeah. hey, this goes to that lady right there. which one? that one, right there. excuse me. excuse me! yes! mm hm. we ordered our food an hour ago. what did you order? elk stew and two beers. oh, i'm sorry, folks. we're out of stew. how did that happen? an hour ago we had stew. how about a burger? i don't want a burger. i want what i ordered. how'd you like that burger cooked? i'd suggest, uh, medium well. these are on the house. thank you. no problem. and i'll go check on that stew for you. honey, this is a business. there are no freebies. well, there are when it comes to making the customers happy. ugh. this isn't one of your bad haircuts. getting a burger instead of stew isn't gonna ruin anyone's day. i'm considered one of clear river's most sought after stylists. congratulations. anyway, we're out of stew. well, preacher keeps a stash in the walk in for emergencies. whoa! oh, brady. i'm sorry. i'll. clean it up in a bit, okay? what? preacher keeps a stash in the walk in for emergencies. then go and get it. yeah, that's what i was just doing. sure looks like you could use some help. you focus on getting our divorce finalized. yeah, number one on my to do list. i found the stew. i'm gonna get that right out for you guys, okay? it'll be just five minutes. what is your beef with charmaine? she's fine in small doses, but i've seen too much of her in the last two days, i've had my fill. can you just stop meddling in other people's business? she's wrong for jack. that is not for you to say. says who? well, i'm guessin' charmaine and jack. ughh! okay. okay? oh, damn it. damn it. damn it. so, what's the move? we can't leave the tourniquet on more than two hours. it'll cut off circulation to the rest of his leg. sew him up. i can't sew him up. we don't have the equipment. even if we did, he could end up with a massive infection that could kill him. if he loses much more blood, he's not gonna survive. once he passes out, i think i can get the other guys to get him to the hospital. it's too late for that. he'll bleed out on the way. what are you two whispering about there? i need a knife. we're almost there. okay, great. you good? yep. i'm good. okay, i need him to stay still. he can't move his leg until i'm finished. when i'm done, i need you to pour saline and then alcohol to sterilize the wound, okay? yep. got it? saline and then alcohol. yeah, i got it. what are you doin' now? i need to stop the bleeding. by burnin' him? do you want him to die? no. okay, then do what i say. okay, great. can you hold down his legs? ready? yep. okay. okay. hold him down. okay. jack? jack? jack's bar. is jack there? what's that? i can't hear you. i found jack's truck but not jack. we need three more burgers right now. yeah. man, jack's not here, okay? hello? oww! oof. you need to keep this clean and dry, otherwise the wound could open up and start bleeding again, okay? we'll send doc back up as soon as we get to town. what happened, man? between the blood loss and the pain, he probably just passed out. look, if you care about him at all, you need to take him to a hospital. come on. just drop us at the main road, and we can flag down a car. like you said, he might keep bleeding. then there'll be nobody to look after him. i've done all i can do. well, let's just wait until tomorrow morning, see how he's doing. that's not part of the deal. okay, no, she came to fix him, and that's what she's gonna do. and then if anything happens, it's on you two. there's a decent chance he's not gonna make it through the night. here you go. nighty night. what do you think they're gonna do to us if he dies? well, he's alive now. let's just focus on that. i thought somebody had the flu, or food poisoning, or something. i'm so sorry i dragged you into this. come on. what, did you think i was gonna let you just. run off and have all the fun on your own? here. thanks. here, you take this. but what about you? you're shivering. my mother raised me right. i thought i was leaving gunshot wounds and stabbings back in la. well, even virgin river isn't perfect. yeah, see, but it was supposed to be. come on. what is, though? you okay? yeah, i just. i have a little shrapnel in there. when it's cold like this, it hurts like hell. you know, you can get that removed. well, it's funny. you know, all the. scars and the. the bullet fragments, they're like a map. kind of tells a story. plus, it makes it so i don't ever forget just how lucky i am to still be alive. you know, some of the guys i served with aren't so lucky. where did it happen? uh, it was kandahar. sniper. this little guy. check it out. oof. mm. that was baghdad. ouch. grenade. what about the one on your back? it's a really big scar. it was, um. mosul, uh. mosul. ooh. two screws and a plate. let me guess. you were skiing? snowboarding? surfin', huh? mm hm. oh, just a pound schizophrenic high on pcp. oh, that was my next guess, yeah. yeah. it took two guards and ccs of haldol to pry him off of me. wow, look at us, huh? just two vets sittin' around a campfire swappin' war stories. hm! you should get some sleep. what about you? i'm gonna keep watch. nightcap? yeah. now all i need is a mint on my pillow. and a pillow. you're not gonna have any? i'm on duty, ma'am. here. you're gonna freeze. has anyone heard from jack or mel? nothing here. they would have had to drop the truck off at the auto shop. i'm sure they'll be back shortly. you guys can close up without me, right? huh! look what the cat dragged in. thought you might need help closin'. that's sweet of you. well, thanks. looks like you inherited your mother's soft spot for doc. there's probably something i should do in the kitchen. i know i said i'd stay and wait for jack, but, um, it's getting late, so. tell him i was here? i will. thanks. good night. good night. what? i didn't say anything that isn't true. unbelievable. is your attitude about charmaine, is it really from that night years ago? charmaine is not the one who hurt you. you're right. technically, it was her mother who destroyed our marriage. hope. we've gone over this and over this. the night that young boy died. i was devastated, i was. i was not myself. hell, i was thinkin' about going back to the hospital in seattle. you think that wasn't a devastating time for me? i never said it wasn't. but you didn't see me falling into bed with some floozy or trying to run away. i didn't run away. i didn't leave. seattle is where i was from. virgin river is my home. you gave me that. and i love this place, and i. i love you. and i know i made a terrible mistake. and i've apologized. why can't you just let it go? you just don't get it. i don't. i don't. can you just explain it? if you haven't gotten it by now, you never will. you snore. i don't snore. mm hm. like a lumberjack. stop. don't exaggerate. no, i'm talking bose stereo surround sound. for a minute, i thought there were two of you. calvin's awake. come take a look. hello? hi. is this hope mccrea? not if you're trying to sell me something, it isn't. no, please don't hang up. i'm looking for mel. mel monroe. who is this? it's her sister, joey barnes. oh, hello. i'm just wondering if you know where mel is. not right this minute, i don't. is everything all right? i've been trying to call since last night. i haven't been able to reach her. it is just not like her to be out of touch for so long. well, there's no obvious signs of an infection, but it could take a few days to present. so? so, considering everything, you're lucky to be alive. so, i'm in the clear. no. you're not in the clear. you don't have a fever now, but you need to stay on top of this. you need to change the dressing two or three times a day. if there's any redness or swelling, or you see any discharge, you need to go to the hospital. so, i guess we can go now. take them to their truck, jimmy. all right, boss. you're welcome. hey. hey! hey, stop. you can't go in there. uh. help her. please. okay? just. hi, there. hi. what's your name? maxine. maxine, my name is mel. i'm a nurse and a midwife. okay? how long have you been in labor? i don't know. um. a few hours. she's, uh, been pushing, but nothing's happening. okay. okay. sh. it's okay. try to breathe, okay?

that's good. that's good. that's good. that's good, okay? damn it. what? what is it? okay, listen. your baby's in a breech position. do you know what that means? okay, it means that the baby is coming out backwards, feet first. it's gonna be fine. i just need you not to push during your next contraction. do you understand? okay? just keep breathing deep breaths and don't push until i tell you to. okay? it's okay. just don't push, okay? you got this. okay, i'm gonna need lots of clean towels. hot water. scissors, and alcohol. calvin says you guys gotta go. you gotta go. are you kidding me?
