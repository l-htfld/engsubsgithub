christ! don't you fucking guys ever sleep? we have a warrant for your arrest. fuck you, pig. todd hockney? who wants to know? new york police department. shit. freeze! hold it! sure you brought enough guys? it's quite simple a restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic. in other words. .the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls. let me give you an example this i had to see for myself. david. i'm in a meeting. time for another one. everyone, this is david kujan. special agent kujan. us customs. these gentlemen are from the new york police department. you look good. better than i would have thought. a small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns. mr. keaton? will you excuse us for a moment? we have some questions to ask you downtown. you'll be a while. no. please, sit down. this is a small problem. enjoy the meal. i'll talk to you later. it didn't make sense that i'd be there. these guys were hard core hijackers. .but there i was. at that point, i wasn't scared. i knew i hadn't done anything they could do me for. besides, it was fun. i got to make like i was notorious. you all know the drill. when your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given. number , step forward. hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker. number , step forward. gimme the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker! knock it off. get back. number , step forward. hand me the keys, you cocksucker. in english, please. excuse me?

hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker. this has really got to be embarrassing for you guys. they drilled us all night. someone was mad about that truck hijacking and the cops had nothing. they were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something. they knew we wouldn't fight, they knew how to lean on us. they've been doing it forever. our rights went out the window. it was a violation. disgraceful. they went after mcmanus first. topnotch entry man. what truck? the truck with the guns, fucko. fucko ? he was a good guy. crazy, though. wanna know what your pal fenster told us? say who? mcmanus. he told us another story. is that the one about the hooker with the dysentery? fenster always worked with mcmanus. he was a real tight ass. but when it came to the job, he was right on. a smart man. what are you saying? i said he'll flip you. he'll what? flip you. flip you for real. i'm shaking. come on. okay. answer my questions. can you hear me in the back? hello? i want my lawyer. i'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker. todd hockney good with explosives. without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody. you guys don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on. you think so, tough guy?

i fuck your father in the shower, and have a snack. are you gonna charge me, dickhead? i'll charge you when i'm ready. with what? you know damn well, dead man. but keaton? keaton was the real prize for them for obvious reasons. it was your mistake, not mine. did you ever stop to ask me? i've been walking around with the same face, the same name. i'm a businessman. what's that? the restaurant business? no. from now on you're in the getting fucked by us business. i'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker. like i said. .it was your mistake. .not mine. you charge me with this shit. .and i'll beat it. okay? let's get back to the truck, asshole. really, somebody's got to do something about this shit. they put me in holding every five minutes. so i did a little time. does that mean i get railed every time a truck finds it's way gone? fuck 'em. fenster, will you relax? these guys don't have any probable cause. you fuckin' right. no pc. you're goddamn right. you do some time, never let you go. they treat me like a criminal. i'll end up a criminal. you are a criminal. why'd you got to go and do that? i'm trying to make a point. why don't you make your point? you're making me tired all over. fuck it then. i heard you were dead. yeah? you heard right. word i got is you hung up your spurs. what's that all about? what's this? rumor has it keaton's gone straight. i hear he's tapping edie finneran. who's that? she's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown. i hear she's keaton's meal ticket. how 'bout it, keaton? you a lawyer's wife? what kind of retainer you giving her? do your friend a favor. .tell him to keep quiet. dean keaton. gone clean? say it ain't so. or was it you that hit that truck? mac, forget him. did you get to talk to your lawyer? this whole thing was a shakedown. what makes you say that? how many times you been in a lineup? it's always you and four dummies. the pd are paying homeless guys a head half the time. there's no way they'd line five felons in the same row. what's a voice lineup? public defender could get you out of that. why the hell was i strip searched? it was the feds. a truckload of guns gets snagged. customs comes down on nypd for answers. they come up with us. they're clutching at straws. i had a guy's finger up my ass. is it friday already? yeah, lover boy. you want a piece? jump in. i'll love you. so who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck? what did you say? who stole the fucking truck? i don't want to know. who asked you, workingman?

i walked. days, suspended. so you did it. all right, now look. .we've all been put out by this whole thing, right? i figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity. now, me and fenster heard about a little job. why don't you just calm down? what do you care what he has to say? i'm just talking here. it seems to me like mr. hockney wants to hear it. .and i know fenster's down. what about you, guy? i'm interested. there. see? i'd like to exercise my right to free assembly. why don't you just shut up? you're missing the point. no. you're missing the point. i don't want to hear anything from you. i don't care about your job. and. .i want nothing to do with any of you. i beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell. dean keaton. .gone the high road. what is the world coming to? fuck him. and that was how it started five of us brought in on a trumped up charge. .to be leaned on by half wits. i really can't talk about it much here. what the cops never figured out, and what i know now. .was that these men would never break, never lie down. never bend over for anybody. anybody. who are you? agent jack baer, fbi. how many dead? so far. they're still pulling bodies out of the water. any survivors? two. one guy's in county hospital, but he's in a coma. the da has a second guy, a cripple from new york. the chief wants this place sealed off. if you have any questions, give him a call. this is dave kujan. i'll be in los angeles until tuesday. if you need to reach me, contact jeff rabin of the san pedro police department. .at extension . have a nice day. why can't i see him? i told you. .the da came down here last night ready to arraign. .even before they moved him to county. kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later. .the da comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him around. they take his statement, and they cut him a deal. did they charge him with anything? weapons, misdemeanor . what is that? i give the da credit for getting that much, you understand? excuse me, sir. this whole thing has turned political. the mayor was here last night. the chief. this morning, the governor called, okay?

no, no. if this was a dope deal, where's the dope? if it was a hit, who called it? i'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions. you know what i think. that's crazy, and it doesn't even matter. the guy's got total immunity. his story checks out. he doesn't know what you want to know. i don't think he does, not exactly. but there's a lot more to his story, believe me. i wanna know why men died on that pier. .for what looks to be million worth of dope that wasn't there. and above all, i want to be sure dean keaton's dead. he's dead. come on. two hours. just till he makes bail. they're all dead. i don't care how tough you say keaton was. .nobody on that boat could've come out alive. is he talking?

about a dean keaton, mostly. i'd like to start at the lineup back in new york. can i get some coffee? in a while. let's talk about the lineup. i'm really thirsty. i used to dehydrate as a kid. once i got so bad my piss come out like snot. it was all thick and gooey i'll get your fucking coffee. get me one, too, while you're at it. that guy is tense. tension is a killer. i used to be in a barbershop quartet in skokie, lllinois. the baritone was this guy named kip diskin, big fat guy. like, orca fat. he was so stressed in the morning you know we're trying to help you. sure, and i appreciate that. and i wanna help you, agent kujan. i like cops. i would've liked to have been a fed, but my cp you're not tellin' us everything. i know you know something. i told the da everything i know. i know you like keaton. i know you think he's a good man. i know he was good. he was a corrupt cop. sure. years ago, but he was a good thief. the cops wouldn't let him go legit. dean keaton was a piece of shit. are you trying to get a rise out of me? i just wanna hear your story. it's all there. may i have a cigarette? according to your statement i need a light. according to your statement, you're a short con operator. .run of the mill according to your statement, you're a short con operator. .run of the mill scams. it's been suppressed. anything in there is inadmissible. i know. sweet deal you have here. total immunity. i do have the weapons charge. i'm lookin' at six whole months hard time. you know a dealer named ruby deemer? you know a religious guy named john paul? you know ruby's in attica? he didn't have my lawyer. i know ruby. he's big on respect. he's a good friend of mine, likes me very much. i know your testimony is sealed. ruby's well connected. he's got lots of friends inside who do favors for him. what would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the da? there's nothing there on ruby. i'll be sure to mention that to him. know what i've learned on the job? how to spot a murderer. say you arrest three guys for the same killing. put them in jail overnight. next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man. if you're guilty, you know you're caught. you let your guard down. you follow me? no. let me get to the point. i'm smarter than you, and i'm gonna find out what i wanna know. i'll get it, whether you like it or not. i'm not a rat. thanks. when i was pickin' beans in guatemala we used to make fresh coffee. right off the trees, i mean. that was good. this is shit, but i'm in a police station. can we get started again? what happened after the lineup? the desk sergeant was telling me he couldn't release you. can you believe that? you weren't even charged. damn police. i wanna have pictures taken of your face. i'll take them to the da tomorrow. forget about it. i'll have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday. i don't want to talk about it, okay? what did fortier and renault say? they asked for more time to think about investing. damn it. more time for what? no matter how you cover my tracks they're still gonna find out about me. give me some credit. i got you this far. let's go to the grand jury. this isn't gonna stop if we don't it's never going to stop, period. by next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us. it's finished. i'm finished. don't give up on me now. it's never gonna stop. i love you. they ruined me in there tonight. i love you. do you hear me? what? all right. let's just go to my place. we'll worry about this tomorrow. let's go. fenster and mcmanus had a cagey proposition a fast jump, high risk, long money. we all knew it could be done. the way i figured, to do it wrong meant killing. to do it right took five men. five men meant keaton. keaton took convincing. new york's finest taxi service. bullshit. bullshit. they don't operate anymore. mcmanus has a friend in the th precinct. they're coming out for one job, thursday. they're pickin' up a guy smuggling emeralds from south america. mcmanus already has a fence set up. a fence? who? some guy in california called redfoot. i never heard of him. you have to come. what's it to you whether i do it or not? they don't know me. you do. they won't take me unless you go. look at me. i need this. you're telling me you don't need this? is this your place? i'm not knocking you. you got a good scam going with this lawyer. sorry. it's okay. you say it's the real thing? that's cool. you okay? i was out of line. but they're never gonna stop with us. you know that. as clean as you get, they'll never let you go now. this way, we hit the cops where it hurts, and we get well in the meantime. you sure you're okay? i'll be all right. look, i. .sometimes get forget it. i'll probably shit blood tonight. so. .how do they wanna do it? mcmanus wants to go in shooting. i say no. fenster? hockney? they're pretty pissed off. they'll do anything. i got a way to do it without killing anyone. but like i say, they won't let me in without you. million? maybe more. no killing. not if we do it my way. new york's finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service. it was a ring of corrupt cops in the nypd that ran a high profit racket. .driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city. for a mile, you got your own blue and white. .and a police escort. they even had their own business cards. after a while, somebody started asking questions, and the taxi service shut down. ever since then, internal affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act. that's where we came in. so, how was the flight? fuckin' great. will this get me to staten island? are you kiddin' me? this will get you to cape cod. mcmanus came to us with the job. fenster got the vans. hockney supplied the hardware. i came through with how to do it so no one got killed. but keaton? keaton put on the finishing touch. a little fuck you from the five of us to the nypd. watch this. careful. come on, asshole! holy shit! don't move, you fucker! drop it now, motherfucker! drop the fuckin' gun! drop it! don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing. what do you guys want? put your fuckin' thing away. we're cops! stupid assholes! watch the glass! don't fuckin' move, motherfucker! you want a buckshot shampoo, chubby? shut up! fuck. 'afternoon, my little pork chops. give me the shit. don't move! give him the shit! give him the fuckin' thing! give him the fuckin' shit, man! hurry up! come on! now the money! there's no money. give me the money now! there's no fuckin' money. give him the fuckin' money! do it! give him the money! give me the money! give him the money! hurry up! you know who the fuck i am? you people know who the fuck i am? fuck! we do now, jerk off. cocksucker. wait a minute. what's that? what the fuck? holy shit! go! keaton made an anonymous phone call. the press was on the scene before the police were. strausz and rizzi were indicted three days later. within a few weeks, more cops went down with them. everybody got it right in the ass, from the chief on down. it was beautiful. i owe you . . dr. keaton. there's more here than i thought. when's the fence coming? redfoot never comes to see me. i always go to see him. in california? yes, verbal, in california. fenster and i wait, hold the fuckin' phone. you and fenster? no. you fuckin' kiddin' me? so then, who's gonna go? we all go. what's your fuckin' problem, man? my problem, is you and fenster honeymooning in california. .while the rest of us are sittin' here holding our dicks. the job's over. cool it. la's a good place to lay low for a while. you wanna dance? ladies. i would like to propose a toast. there you go. to mr. verbal. .the man with the plan. we're gonna miss the flight. don't do this. send her a note. something. i said we'll make it. we're gonna miss the plane. she'll understand. that's heartwarming. really. i'm weepy. you wanna wait outside? you guys wanted to know what happened. i'm telling you. come on, verbal. who do you think you're talkin' to? you expect me to believe that he retired? for a woman? bullshit. keaton was using her. he loved her. sure. i'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea. it was all fenster and mcmanus. keaton was a cop for four years. who else would know better? that job had his name on it. edie had him turned around. let me tell you something. i know dean keaton. i've been investigating him for the past three years. the guy i know was a cold blooded bastard. iad indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force. don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold. you got him all wrong. do i? dean keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force. in every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony. .or died before they could testify. when they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in sing sing. he killed three prisoners inside. of course, i can't prove this. .but i can't prove the best part either. dean keaton was dead. did you know that? he died in a fire two years ago, during an investigation into the murder. .of a witness who was going to testify against him. two people saw dean keaton walk into a warehouse he owned. .just before it blew up. they said he went in to check a leaking gas main. it blew up and took all of dean keaton with it. within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead. one killed himself in his car. the other fell down an open elevator shaft. let's get this show on the road. this is not what we discussed. there are too many i promise we'll be out before he blows his porch light. i have a noon meeting. five minutes. everyone calm down, all right? i want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor. he says they were buying dope. we know. he doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope. people. what? he needs guarantees. what is he talking about, guarantees? he says his life is in danger. he saw the devil. looked him in the eye. i'm on my way. no, wait a minute. ask him to tell him what he told me. .about the devil. who's the devil? keyser soze. keyser soze? he was in the harbor, killing many men. he saw keyser soze? he saw his face. all right. tell him to tell her what he looks like. describe him. six weeks ago, i get an anonymous phone call. .telling me i can find keaton eating at mondino's, and there he is. because he never profited from his alleged death. .and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him. .we had to let him go. he was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over. and then he had lunch. i don't know about that. i don't think you do, but you say you saw keaton die. i think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there. i think he's behind that circus at the harbor. my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and think he's your friend. you tell me he's dead, so be it. i wanna be sure before i go back to new york. he wasn't behind anything. it was the lawyer. what lawyer? what lawyer? back when i was in that barbershop quartet you don't think i know you held out on the da? what did you leave out? i could be on the phone to ruby in minutes. the da gave me immunity. not from me. you get no immunity from me, you piece of shit. every criminal i have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor. .every creep and scumbag that walks the street. .will know the name of verbal kint. you talk to me. .or that precious immunity they grant you. .won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on. there was a lawyer. kobayashi. is he the one that killed keaton? no, but i'm sure keaton is dead. convince me. tell me every last detail. we arrived in los angeles and met mcmanus' fence, redfoot. he had a good reputation. seemed like a good guy. still, we should have known better. how you doing? good. you? not bad. can't complain. how's it going, fenster? don't need to open it, right? you must be keaton. redfoot, dean keaton. todd hockney and verbal kint. verbal, the man with the plan. you interested in more work? we're always looking for extra work. we're on vacation. that's too bad. i got a ton of work and no good people. not like you guys. what's the job? there's this jeweler out of texas named saul. he rents a suite in some downtown hotel. he does free appraisals. sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't. the word is, he carries around a lot of cash. so i figure, i keep the merchandise, you keep the green. simple. what about security? a couple of bodyguards. nothing you couldn't handle. give me time to check it out? i expect nothing less from you, man. good to see you. we'll call you. enjoy la. get yourself laid. a friend in new york tells me that you knew spook hollis. the way i hear it, you did time with ol' spook. a good man, wasn't he? i used to run dope for him. too bad he got shivved. i shivved him. better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later. i appreciate that. but just out of curiosity. .was it business or personal? a bit of both. like i said. .you give me a call if you're interested. is there a problem? one job. that was the deal. one job? one job? that's a good one. keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is. he can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself. it took one day with mcmanus nagging, and we went back to work. i get out of my car, and the thing is wrecked. i look in the backseat of the other car, and this woman's totally naked. i'm laughin' so hard i can't breathe. get in the car, saul. freeze, motherfucker! stay right there! there's a second one here, somewhere. gimme the case. give me the fuckin' case! give me the fuckin' case. i'm tellin' you for the last time. give me the fuckin' case! come on! don't move! hand over the case. hand over the fuckin' case. come on, let's go! come on! bad day. fuck it. let's go! fuck. looks like a lot of china to me. shit. guys, come on. what are you doin'? i'm gonna kill him. we did it your way, now we'll do it mine. you gonna kill him? i'll deal with him. you'd better, or i'm gonna. shut up. what am i supposed to do with that? feed it to the gimp. ease his pain. i don't know what that is. what do you mean? i don't know. i got thrown this job by some lawyer. who? i don't know. some limey. he's a middleman for somebody. he doesn't say, i don't ask. you're fuckin' full of shit! fuck you. fuck you. listen to me. we wanna meet him, okay? that's funny. he called me last night. he says he wants to meet you guys. okay, we'll meet him. i'll call you. good. let's go. i don't like it. wait a minute. one more thing, tough guy any more surprises, and i'm gonna kill you. you're such a tough guy. but do me a favor, all right? get the fuck off my dick. no! put a leash on that puppy. it's an awful shame about saul gettin' whacked. cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it. sooner or later, they're gonna come around askin' me. you have a sweet night, ladies. fuck you. so this lawyer kobayashi. came from redfoot. right. and why leave this out when you talked to the da? dave, someone to see you. i've been looking all over for you. you still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath yesterday? you can stop looking. there was no coke. i've been in la county talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe. .yesterday after the shootout. he came to this morning, he started talking. he's part of a hungarian mob. they dealt with gwats from argentina. he says it was definitely not a dope deal. but there were we know. but he says no on the dope. this hungarian tells me they were pulling stumps for turkey the next day. they had no time for that kind of product, and no means to move it. what's the money for? he didn't know. no one doing the deal knew except for a few key people. they were all very hush about it, he says. whatever it was, it was very sensitive. i don't get it. you got the cripple in there from new york? did he mention keyser soze? who? just bear with me here. who's keyser soze? fuck! we've been goin' over this for an hour and a half. what we need to do is find redfoot and get the hell out of here now. what we need to do is think. think back. somebody with power. .somebody capable of tracking us from new york to la. what the hell are we doing here? we're waiting. sit down. no. i'm hot, and i'm fuckin' bored. mr. hockney, do stay. mr. keaton. mr. fenster i recognize from his mug shots. .as well as mr. mcmanus. i can only assume that you are mr. kint, the gentleman who disposed of saul berg. my employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit. i am mr. kobayashi. i have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen. what do you want? my employer requires your services. one job, one day's work. very dangerous. he does not expect all of you to live. but those of you who do. .will have million to divide between you in any way you see fit. who's your boss? i work for keyser soze. who's keyser soze? judging by the sudden change in mood. .i feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you. i come with an offer directly from mr. soze. an order, actually. what do you mean, an order ? in , you participated in the hijacking of a truck in buffalo, new york. the cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to mr. soze. .and which was destined for pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor. a most profitable violation of un regulations. you had no way of knowing this. .because the fellow shipping the steel was working for soze. .without his knowledge. earlier this year, mr. fenster and mr. mcmanus. .hijacked a two prop cargo flight out of newark airport. the plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for pakistan. two months ago, mr. hockney stole a truck. .carrying gun parts through queens. gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of new york. they were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to belfast. again, mr. soze using pawns who had no knowledge. which brings us to mr. kint. nine months ago, one of mr. soze's. .less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam. .by a cripple. he was relieved of , . now, it has taken us some time to find you. our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in new york. you set up the lineup. yes. you were not to be released until i had come to see you. it seems mr. keaton's attorney, miss finneran. .was a little too effective in expediting his release. holding the rest of you became a moot point. what about redfoot? mr. redfoot knew nothing. mr. soze rarely works with the same people for long. .and they never know who they're working for. one cannot be betrayed if one has no people. so, why are you telling us? because you have stolen from mr. soze, mr. fenster. all of you. that you did not know it is the only reason you're still alive. he feels you owe him. you will repay your debt. fuck the debt, and fuck you. how do we know you work for soze? i don't think that is very relevant. all five of you are responsible for the murder of saul berg. .and his bodyguards. mr. redfoot can testify to your involvement. we can see to it that he will. what's your point? the offer is this, gentlemen mr. soze's primary interest. .is narcotics. he has been competing, shall we say. .with a group of argentineans for several years. competing with mr. soze has taken its toll. these argentineans are negotiating the sale. .of million in cocaine in three days time. needless to say, this purchase will revitalize. .the diminishing strength of their organization. mr. soze would like you to stop the deal. if you choose, you may wait until after the buy. whatever money changes hands is yours. mr. soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard. and then you will be free of your obligations to mr. soze. give me one good reason why i shouldn't kill you right now. a gift from mr. soze. good day, gentlemen. they got my whole life in here, everything i've done since i was . they fuckin' know everything. everybody i've ever worked with or did time with. no. this isn't right. i don't know. who's that guy who used to talk about soze in new york? bricks marlin. he did jobs for him, indirect stuff. he said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth. this guy's a pipe dream. kobayashi's using him for window dressing. i don't know. this is bad. it's bullshit. this guy could be lapd. it's a fuckin' setup. the way i hear it, soze's some kind of butcher. a peerless, psycho, fucked up butcher. there is no keyser soze! who is keyser soze? he's supposed to be turkish. some say his father was german. nobody ever believed he was real. nobody knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him. to hear kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for soze. you never knew. that was his power. the greatest trick the devil ever pulled. .was convincing the world he didn't exist. one story the guys told me, the story i believe. .was from his days in turkey. there was a gang of hungarians that wanted their own mob. they realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns. .or money or even numbers. you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't. after a while they come into power, and then they come after soze. he was small time then. just running dope, they say. they come to his home. .in the afternoon looking for his business. they find his wife and kids in the house, and decide to wait for soze. he comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming. the hungarians knew soze was tough, not to be trifled with. they let him know they meant business. no! they tell him they want his territory, all his business. soze looks over the faces of his family. then he showed these men of will what will really was. he tells them he would rather see his family dead. .than live another day after this. he lets the last hungarian go. .waits until his family is in the ground, and goes after the rest of the mob. he kills their kids, he kills their wives. .he kills their parents and their friends. he burns down the houses they live in. .and the stores they work in. he kills people that owe them money. and like that. .he's gone, underground. nobody's ever seen him since. he becomes a myth. a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night. rat on your pop, and keyser soze will get you. no one ever really believes. do you believe in him? keaton always said i don't believe in god, but i'm afraid of him. i believe in god. and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze. you give any weight to this? i can introduce you to dan metzheiser from justice. he's got a file on soze in dc. it's been a hobby of his for a while. a lot of guys equate him to that reporter on the incredible hulk. you've heard of him? where? on the street? a few times. you know, outside stuff. someone working for a guy who worked for a guy who got money from soze. shit like that. it could be an old badge. a hex sign. keep people from fucking with you when a name meant something. but you're here. shit, yeah. this guy's trying to walk out of a hospital because he's so afraid of soze. i'll run it up the flagpole. i came clean. i told it like it happened. so what about how i got there? it's so full of holes, the da would've told me to forget amnesty. you got what you wanted out of me. big deal. that's why you never told the da? you tell me. if i told you the loch ness monster hired me, what would you say? turn state's evidence. we'll put you on the stand. i've got immunity. what can you possibly offer me? if there really is a keyser soze, he's gonna come lookin' for you. where's your head? where do you think the pressure is? keyser soze, or whatever you call him, knows where i am right now. he has the burner on your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up minutes later. immunity was just a deal with you assholes. i got a new problem when i post bail. why play into his hands? we can protect you. thanks, dave. bang up job so far. extortion, coercion. pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker. the same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out? fuck you. you think you can catch keyser soze? you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught. .and sticks his head out? if he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me. after that. .my guess is you'll never hear from him again. what happened next? we woke up the next morning and fenster was gone. he couldn't handle the idea of slumming for soze. he left us a note wishing us good luck. .and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together. then what? mcmanus was furious. he talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out. all sorts of shit. that night, we got the call. what call? kobayashi told us where we could find fenster. let's get the fuck out of here. we gotta bury him. with what? with our hands. this is nuts. it's dry fucking sand. when he rots the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away. dig, you fuck. what are we gonna do? this fuckin' guy is gonna kill us. i don't know about you, peg leg, but i can run. i got no problem with that. kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either. you run, and we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you. you got that? this ain't my boy we're burying. i don't owe anybody! so fuck you. he was my partner for five years. we did more jobs and i saw more money than you can ever count. so fuck you! 'cause now it's payback! it's not payback! it's precaution. you want payback? you wanna run? i don't care. i'm not doin' this for fenster. i'm not doin' it for you. i'm doin' this for me. i'm gonna finish this thing. this kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me. after they killed fenster, nobody would run? i wanted to. i thought we could make it. why didn't you say anything? believe me, i tried, but keaton wouldn't have it. it was too far fetched for him. keaton was a grounded guy. an ex cop. to a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. it's always simple. there's no mystery to the street, no arch criminal. you got a body and think his brother did it, you're probably right. nobody argued with keaton. they just set their minds to whacking kobayashi. they're coming up. did you hear me? he's coming up. he's on his way down. don't move. press . do it now. move. the answer is no. mr. soze will be most listen, cocksucker, there is no keyser soze. mention his name again, i'll kill you right now. a strange threat. i assume you've come here to kill me anyway. we know that you can get to us. .but now you know that we can get to you. i'm giving you one last chance to call this off. my employer has made up his mind. he does not change it. neither do we. you got fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us. not before one of us gets through to you. i believe you. i most sincerely do. you would not have been chosen were you not so suitable. but i cannot make this decision. whatever you threaten me with is. .ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me. .if i do not carry out my orders in full. i'm the guy that's gonna get you. i just wanted you to know that. i'm so sorry. i implore you, believe me. .mr. soze is very real. .and very determined. we'll see. before you do me in. .you will let me finish my business with miss finneran first, won't you? what did you say? edie finneran. she's upstairs in my office. .for an extradition deposition. i requested she be put on the case personally. she flew in yesterday. no matter. kill away. you're lying. am i? miss finneran's escort while she's here in los angeles. never leaves her for a moment. i thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands. get some rest. the boat will be ready for you on friday. if i see you or any of your friends before then. .miss finneran will be the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies. as indeed will your father, mr. hockney. .and your uncle randall in arizona, mr. kint. i might only castrate mr. mcmanus' nephew, david. do i make myself clear? we will take care of the two bodies downstairs. we'll add them to the cost of mr. fenster. if you'll excuse me, gentlemen. it's a logistical nightmare. close quarters. , maybe men. there's no tellin' how many more are gonna be below deck. can we stealth these guys? with all that coke, they're gonna be ready. which brings me to sunny point number . even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'. what if we wait for the money? ten more men at least. in my opinion, it can't be done. anyone who goes in is not comin' out alive. i'm gonna wait for the money. me, too. did you hear what he just said? if i'm goin' in, i want a cut. me, too. there's nothing that can't be done. i just can't believe we're gonna walk in to certain death. the news said it's raining in new york. what language is that? i don't know. russian, i think. hungarian? the package has arrived, gentlemen. you kids ready? i would be if i didn't have to stop and answer you. i'm ready. mcmanus, you better be set up in seconds. i'm ready. i want you to stay here. i'm supposed to cover if we don't get out of this, take the money and go. i can't find edie. tell her everything that happened. she knows people. she knows what to do. if i don't get kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way. what if i just do what i say. please. tell her that. tell her i tried. mcmanus, he's on his way. i'm there. one, two, three, four. .five, six, seven. oswald was a fag. hi. how you doin'? is there a problem? now. old mcdonald had a farm ee aye, ee aye, o and on that farm, he shot some guys elvis has left the building. hold fire. hold fire. vamonos! hello. why didn't you run? i froze up. i thought about fenster and how he looked when we buried him. then i thought about keaton, and it looked like he might pull it off. a boy found a body on the beach today. thrown clear of the boat. shot twice in the head. two guys from the bureau identified him. what else? his name was arturo m rquez. a petty smuggler from argentina. he was arrested last year in new york for trafficking. he escapes to california. they pick him up in long beach. they're setting up extradition, he escapes again. now, get this. edie finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings. kobayashi. new york faxed me a copy of his testimony. he was a rat. a big fucking rat. arturo was very opposed to returning to prison. so much so, that he named close to people. guess who he named in the finale. keyser soze. there's more. i'll tell you what i know. stop me when this sounds familiar. there was no dope on that boat. you, stay quiet. he's here. i know he's here. that's him. i'm telling you, that's him. i know he's here! you can't understand. that's him. shut up. that's him. you hear me? i'm telling you, it's keyser soze! where's hockney? i don't know. there's no coke. what? you heard me, dumb fuck. there's no coke! what the fuck? no coke? i've been up and down in every fucking room. there's gotta be coke! there is nothing! nothing! don't you fuck with me. there is no fucking coke! i'm out of here. i told them nothing. i swear. i told them nothing. please. what the fuck is goin' on? the strangest thing. that's what you said. you saw a man in a suit with a slim build. wait a minute. are you saying you saw keyser soze? you said you didn't know who it was. i know there was dope on that boat. stop stallin'. i'm not. you know what i'm getting at. get out of my face. i got immunity. i don't have to take this. you know what i'm getting at. i don't know what you're talking about. the truth! try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton. i did. you're lying to me. you've known this whole time. i don't know what you're saying. i did see keaton get shot. i swear to you. why didn't you help him? you had a gun. he was your friend. because i was afraid. afraid. afraid of what? afraid of i knew it was keyser soze. it was keyser soze, i mean, the devil himself. how do you shoot the devil in the back? what if you miss? let's get back to the pier. arturo m rquez. ever hear of him? what? no. he was a stool pigeon for the justice department. he swore out a statement to federal marshals. .saying that he had seen and could positively identify one. .keyser soze. it says right here in the report. he had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including. .but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder. i never heard of him. his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians. most likely the same hungarians that soze all but wiped out back in turkey. the money wasn't there for dope. the hungarians were going to buy the one guy. .that could incriminate keyser soze. i said i never heard of him. but keaton did. edie finneran was m rquez's extradition advisor. she knew who he was and what he knew. there were no drugs on that boat. it was a hit. a suicide mission to whack out the one guy. .that could finger keyser soze. so soze put some thieves to it. .men he knew he could march into certain death. you're saying soze sent us to kill someone? i'm saying keaton did. he left you behind for a reason. just do what i tell you. if you all knew that soze could find you anywhere. .why did he give you the money to run? he could have used you on the boat. he wanted me to live. a one time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world. .finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple? no, sir. why? edie. i don't buy that reform story for a minute. even if i did. .i certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. so why? because he was my friend. no, he wasn't your friend. keaton didn't have friends. what are you doing here? he saved you because he wanted it that way. it was his will. keaton was keyser soze. no. a man who could wrangle the wills of men like hockney and mcmanus. a man who could engineer a police lineup. .through all his years of contacts in nypd. the kind of man who could've killed edie finneran. she was found yesterday at a hotel in pennsylvania. .shot twice in the head. what do you think about keaton now? edie? he used all of you to get him on that boat. he couldn't get on alone. he had to pull the trigger himself. .to make sure he got his man. .the one man that could identify him. this is all bullshit. you said you saw him die. or did you? you had to hide when you heard the police cars. you said you heard the shot before the fire. .but you didn't see him die. i knew him. he would never he programmed you. he programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to. he knew we were close. you said it yourself. where was the political pressure to protect you from? it was keaton. immunity was your reward. but why me? why not fenster or mcmanus or hockney? why me? i'm stupid. i'm a cripple. why me? because you're a cripple. because you're stupid. because you're weaker than them. if he's dead. if what you say is true, then it won't matter. it was his idea to hit the taxi service, wasn't it? come on, tell me the truth. it was all keaton. we followed him from the beginning. i didn't know. i saw him die. i believe he's dead. christ. you're not safe on your own. you think he's. keyser soze? i don't know. keyser soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story. but i know keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you. stay here and let us protect you. i'm not bait. i post today. you posted minutes ago. capt. leo wants you out of here. unless you turn state's. i'll take my chances. if someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there. turn state's evidence. you might never see trial. maybe so. but i'm not a rat. fuckin' cops. excuse me, can i use your fax machine? you'll have to sign for these, mr. kint. one watch, gold. one cigarette lighter, gold. one pack of cigarettes. thank you. we still got nothing. i know what i wanted to know about keaton. which is nothing. no matter. he'll have to know how close we came. keyser soze or no keyser soze. .if keaton is alive, he's not comin' up again. i'll find him. waste of time. a rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die. what? nothing. man, you're a slob. but it all has a system. it all makes sense if you look at it right. you gotta stand back from it. you wanna see a real horror show? see my garage. convince me. tell me every last. when i was in that barbershop quartet in skokie, illinois. where's your head? we need to think, think back. i'm sure you've heard tall tales. bricks marlin. this isn't right. i just wanna hear your story. it's all there. i'm tellin' it straight. some guy in california called redfoot. a gift from mr. soze. talk to me. what about redfoot? mr. redfoot knew nothing. using pawns. a big fat guy. like, orca fat. there was a lawyer. kobayashi. when i was picking beans in guatemala we made fresh coffee. i know you thought he was a good man. i know he was good. you tell me every last detail. the strangest thing. how do you shoot the devil in the back? this guy is protected from up on high by the prince of. what's your story, pretzel man? there was a lawyer. what lawyer? i am mr. kobayashi. kobayashi. kobayashi. tell me every last detail. i work for keyser soze. convince me. convince me. every creep and scumbag that works the street. .will know the name of verbal kint. the cripple, did you see him? the cripple! which way did he go? he went out that way. i know you know something. i know you're not telling. i'm smarter than you. .and i'm gonna find out whether you like it or not. to a cop, the explanation is never complicated. it's always simple. the truth! there's no arch criminal behind it all. somebody with power, somebody who is capable. keyser soze! you think a guy like that gets this close to getting caught. .and sticks his head out? because you're stupid. because you're a cripple. what i wanna know is, who's the gimp? you've known the whole fuckin' time. if he comes up for anything it'll be for me. i'm sure keaton is dead. i can't feel my legs, keyser. first thing i learned on the job. you know what? how to spot a murderer. you got the cripple in there? did he mention keyser soze? who? after that. .my guess is you'll never hear from him again. the greatest trick the devil ever pulled. .was convincing the world he didn't exist. and like that. .he's gone
