paulie, you know where i come out on all this, buddy. to me, marriage is an archaic and oppressive institution. .that should a been abolished years ago. and love? it's magical comfort food for the weak and the uneducated. yeah, it makes you feel all warm and relevant. .but in the end, love leaves you weak, dependant and fat. yeah, that might not make the best toast. are you saying i'm fat? no. are you kidding? paul no, no, no. no, sweetie, sweetie, he's being funny, i think. better hold your next words real close, paco. believe me, all right? for paul's sake, i wish i could believe in all this crap. i do. and i also wish i could believe in the easter bunny. .the missile shield, and strippers with a heart of gold, all right?

no. crabs? no. took her to the coat room, found out she had a tenpin up her dress? don't worry, it happens to all of us. wait, what? nothing, nothing, nothing. so, what happened? jenny kissed pete hastings tonight. her first kiss. now everything is ruined. i don't even know if we're gonna get married anymore. trust me, kid, you dodged a bullet. you don't wanna be anybody's first kiss, or their last. say what you will, that man was a visionary. you know he invented the word milf ? what am i gonna do? i've never felt this way before. i feel like someone has punched me straight in the stomach. .and i feel like i'm gonna throw up. god, i hate girls! that's sissy talk. never talk like that in the stabbing wagon. uncle wayne, where are your seat belts? again with the sissy talk. he never wore seat belts. never. look, kid, i'm, uh, sorry i raised my voice at you. being a parent ain't exactly my chosen profession, you know? i mean, i can't teach you algebra, or camping, or even ethics. but when it comes to dames. .l've got a gift. really? because i will do anything you say. i never wanna feel like this again. ever. okay, dutch. never again. hang on. are we in a bar? think of it like a classroom. hiya, tommy. two jacks. up, please. dutch, try that old saddle out for size. rule number one don't look at them. dames, they're like horses. they spook easy. cheers, dutch. rule number two never soil your wingman. sorry. you're learning on your feet. you know, if we were actually out, uh, chasing tail tonight. .l'd turn your gaffe into a funny. girls, they love to laugh. especially at men. makes them feel more powerful, which in turn makes them feel more comfortable. which in turn makes them prone to massive errors in judgment. .like, having sex with a complete stranger in the port authority bathroom. ha, ha. but i'm not even supposed to talk to strangers. no, that's good, that's good. no talking is good. no phone numbers, no last names. hey, no first names if you can swing it. will somebody please call child protective services? shh. quiet, the prophet speaks. see, kid, an ugly broad, you might as well take her out behind the shed. .and put one behind the ear. that dog won't hunt. but any dude with a johnson, he's got a shot. .because cool comes from the inside. god, i miss that man. wayne so here's a couple of tips. when you first meet a girl, you give her two compliments, above the neck. you tell her she's got nice lips, nice eyes, nice hair. .she's intelligent, her moral ethics, whatever crap comes to your mind. then, just when she begins to think that you're another, you know. .vanilla nice guy that she can tool around with all night without getting naked. .you insult her. flip the power dynamic, and you let her know you're here to play. well, jenny said she doesn't like games. forget about that broad. i thought all this was to get her back. that's why you gotta forget about her. it's your feelings for her that are killing your game. if there's one thing that you learn tonight, it's this the power of a relationship lies with whoever cares less. amen to that, brother. one day you're gonna wake up with some chick, spooning. .you know, thinking about love. and at that moment, you have gotta get up. do not walk, don't get your shoes, run the hell out of there. because maybe not the next day or the next week. .but sometime in the future, you're gonna get crushed. again. you don't wanna feel that way, do you? no. no. yep. okay, so, uh, let's get down to brass tacks here. say i wanted to pick up on that ice cold blond at eight o'clock. eight o'clock? how did you even see her? we'll deal with reflective surfaces at another time. should i, uh, get a handful a daisies, then go hi, you wanna go to the disco with me? uh. no? no. no, because i might as well say, i'm a fag. let's be friends. so, what would be a smart play? have some fun with it. what do you think? i don't know. i mean. .you could maybe talk to the girl next to her?

no. hey. we've known each other our whole lives. it's been too great a night to end it out here. you've gotten really good at this. but you cannot come up. i don't want this to be a one night thing. so you've gotta woo me. why woo when we can just do? ha, ha. huh? the wooing is actually not for my benefit. mm. i can't believe she called me on my crap like that. that is not at all how i remember it. so, what's next? well, now we're gonna watch a romantic montage of you and jenny. .set to cyndi lauper's time after time. awake me when there's an action sequence, will you?

no. because he won't go there. ew. what? that would be me. shut up. shut your face. no. you never told us that. well, i'm paying the price. looks like i'm gonna have to get plastered. .and downgrade to one of paul's desperate work friends. i can transmit, page, pilot and sync channels now. what channel are you on? hey, guys, holster them. why? women. oh. say it isn't so. they're so weird. yeah, somebody is enjoying this a little bit. ha, ha. are you kidding me? connor mead, cleaning up his own mess. i am loving it. you know what? i'm sorry. it's a cake. there'll be a bakery open in town. i'm not talking about this. i'm talking about us. you know? how it played out. you're actually apologizing, aren't you? okay, we don't need to make a production out of it, now. how are things looking? spick and span? any more spots? you know, it was probably, in some small way, partially my fault. i was always attracted to assholes. thank you very much. well, you know what i mean, though. projects. guys that i thought i could fix. probably has something to do with my dad. probably. after you left, i made a vow to myself. .to date only fully functional, well adjusted men. no more works in progress. no dirtbags. so basically, women. basically women. so how strong of a vow is your no dirtbags policy? i had it tattooed on my ass. can i see? no. wait, what are you doing? what? what? what am i doing? wha.? okay, look. i know i dropped the ball before a bit, but i have changed, i swear. no, you haven't. no, i have. jenny, i'm seeing things in a whole different way tonight. all right? i love you. i think. i mean, i always have. you're the one i was supposed to be with. wait, connor, stop it. just. i hear what you're saying, and i think right now you actually believe it. yeah. but i know you. tomorrow morning, i'll wake up. you won't be there. okay, but, jenny, i really, really don't wanna be alone tonight, you know? okay. no, i get it. will you please stay with me? seriously! jenny, i've got ghosts in my bedroom! woman hello, connor. aah! dude. what does a girl have to do to get laid at this wedding? yeah. four seasons, please. come on, start. aah! where do you think you're going? oh, mel. god, you don't know how happy i am to see you. aah! really, did you learn nothing from the last ghost? you're the ghost of girlfriends present? mm hm. that makes no sense. oh, tell me about it. but as sad as it is, i'm the only consistent woman in your life. so here i am, just working on the weekend. again. but we never. i mean, you. you're totally gay, right? what? you're not? no. there was just one time in college. i went to barnard. okay. i had no choice. hey, i'm sorry, mel. if i'd have known, i would of hit on you a lot sooner. aw. ha, ha. ow! what was that for? because tonight, i'm the boss. you ready? what are you doing? aren't we gonna, like, fly off or something? it's the present, you idiot. we're here already. mel. paul okay, no. that is not what i said. woman i don't care. he's a beautiful piece of a man. hey, look at how much fun they're having now that you're gone. he's not shallow. shallow? honey, he spends every christmas alone at the knicks game. yeah, he is all surface. yeah, but in his defense, it's a really hot surface. well, yeah. okay, he's not that bad. thank you, paulie. deena paul, he hit on your mother in law. i've banged worse. thank you, vonda. all oh! you guys just don't know him like i do. you don't. you know, that guy practically raised me. i was when our parents died. connor was just . you know, at an age when he's supposed to be a kid, he's busy taking care of one. he taught me how to read. he taught me how to ride a bike. he beat the crap out of any kid who ever teased me. you know, he always said, paulie, it's you and me against the world. my point is, i had the opportunity to be a nice kid and connor didn't. now, i know he seems like a joke to you guys. .and trust me, you all have fair points, but that guy is the only family i've got. and if there's one thing family does. .it is believe, against all odds, in the best of each other. i love him. and as long as i live, i'll believe he can change, because he's. he's my big brother. i'm gonna call my brother. it's been a while. of course, that doesn't mean anything to you. because love doesn't exist, right? it's just, magical comfort food for the weak and uneducated ? wow, that is as close as i will ever come to feeling something for connor mead. kudos. i saw you chatting him up at the bar. well, i still wanna do him, but now i'll be scrumping a tragic figure. ooh, like when denice hooked up with gary coleman at lollapalooza. i was drunk and he had such delicate hands. denice, you think that's bad? i mean, look at what connor is doing to poor jenny. he has got that girl so twisted up into a pretzel. .she can't even appreciate that fine slice of wedding beefcake. .that sandy has flown in for her. hua! ha, ha. heard, understood, acknowledged? jenny, she's just. jenny. oh, jesus. is she okay? what do you think? brad jenny? oh, of course. sensitive brad to the rescue. now, wait a second, are you actually trying to repair this wedding cake? maybe. i mean, a little. i used to moonlight as a pastry chef. tell me this guy's gay. he's not. trust me. really? no. not really. you wanna talk about it? as your designated wedding sex, everything you say is privileged. no, i just. i mean, it's been like a decade since connor and l. you know. but i see him again, and i am just right back to where i was before. my attending in med school used to say that doctors never break up. .we just go into remission. we're naturally drawn to the most hopeless patients. the irredeemably screwed up. the terminal cases. we get the point, brad. it's just embarrassing, you know? i think you only really get over somebody. .when you find somebody else that you care about more. all right, this is a nightmare. i'm bringing them together. this is a mess. melanie he's really cute too. connor no, no, no. no way. jenny doesn't go for guys like this. no, clearly not. come on, let's go. no, no, no. now hang on. let's see how this plays out. okay. you're the boss. really? nadja such a shvantza. what the hell was that fo.? i just can't believe he broke up with us on a conference call. how did he fool all of us? yeah, but the weirdest thing, really. .it seems like he wanted us to fall in love with him. and once we did, or thought we did, he just disappeared. how messed up is that? come on, kiki. don't cry. at least connor brought us all together, right? hey, there we go, charlece. that's the winning attitude, huh? way to look on the bright side. you've already got new relationships, new friendships, right? here we go. it's so exciting to have people over. martini? oh, this is your apartment? nadja liquor, good. mel. i've got apple, bubble gum or tandoori. i know it sounds gross, but drink two of them. .and you won't be able to feel your face. cheers. you brought them together? come on. don't be sad, you whiny bitches. connor's not worth it. he's like the tin man. he was born without a heart. and, ladies, know this that wherever connor lays his head tonight. .when the sun comes up in the morning, he will be all alone. charlece well, i'll drink to that. nadja i feel much better. so how you holding up, dutch? not too great. yeah. why do all these women hate me? you know, i don't hate them. woman love to be screwed, they just don't like to be screwed over. i know, it's annoying. yeah. i mean. look, all right, maybe i've hurt a few women in my time. a few women? dutch, please. don't con a con man. oh, is this weather tricks? no tricks, dutch. these are all the lady tears that have been shed for you in your life. and these. these are the tissues they used to dry those tears. and these are the chocolates you sent. right. you don't send chocolates. they go straight to the hips. right. and these are all the condoms you used. no. no! no! no! denice no, don't! sandra get off! get off! denice don't! you're out of control! sandra shut up! man, oh, man. you guys are not gonna believe what just happened to me in my car. is this about the cake? this is not about the cake. this is about the fact that paul slept with donna. information that you so kindly shared with denice earlier tonight. come on. all right, number one, that was years ago. there seems to be some debate about the time line. no, there is no debate. we were going out. we were together. you cheated. we had just met. but you're right. you're right. that's not important. what's important is that i hurt you. listen, baby. you know what? don't listen, baby me. you had sex with her. .and then you didn't even tell me. i mean, what else don't i know about you? nothing. nothing. there is nothing else. okay, i am so sorry. sweetie, i never meant to hurt you. cool. right there. hey, he said it. he's sorry. he means it. case closed. case closed. because one apology makes everything all better, right, connor? no, jenny. what makes it okay is that paul still clearly loves her. oh, you're the expert on love. you don't even believe in it. if i can tell that you two love each other, then you must really love each other. you know i do, honey. i love you so much. that girl's been acting like a mental patient for hours. he's still here. shut up. the point is. .how does she even trust him anymore? whoa, are you talking about my brother, or are you talking about me? let's not forget, this all went down with your dear friend donna over there. a fact your little estrogen lynch mob seems to have forgotten. seriously, if you ruled out marrying anyone that your bridesmaids have slept with. .you're gonna have to go abroad to get a husband. go to hell, connor. sandy. paulie, come on. connor, i want you to leave. connor you better air these things out. connor, leave! god, you have done nothing but make this weekend worse for everyone. sandy! paulie! hey, come on. hey, paulie. hey, hey, man. look, i'm sorry. they were right. i never should have invited you. you know, for years i keep trying to convince myself. .there's something redeemable in you. i'm done. there isn't. connor i was just trying to get your back in there, okay? it's you and me against the world, right? you don't wanna be here. and nobody wants you here. so just go. jus. please? sandy! connor i know i've got one more ghost left on my contract. .but i've been asked to leave the premises! so if you want me, come on! of course, i wouldn't mind seeing my future girlfriends. frankly, that was the ghost i was most looking forward to! but whatever! whoa. are you my future girlfriend? would you like to be? oh, hell, no. i get married? wedding march playing on organ oh. okay, this could work. as a matter of fact, this may be all right. brad? no. no, no, no. no, no, no. and now, if anyone here knows any reason why these two should not be wed. connor i do. priest let them speak now. no, jenny, you're supposed to be with me. she was always supposed to be with me. no. don't do this. this is wrong. no. no! i'm here. i'm here. jenny. i'm here. no. no! oh, paulie. no wedding ring. wait a minute. he didn't get married? why? me? what did i do? you don't say much, do you? looks like we're, uh, all here. let's begin. lord, we are gathered here today to lay to rest connor mead. connor mead was a great man and a great friend of the church. there's only one person at my funeral? wayne that's the way it works, dutch. guys like us. .we don't get the big funeral. i didn't expect big, uncle wayne, but this is ridiculous. yeah, i don't know how to soften this one for you, dutch. uh. nobody's really gonna miss you. before the burial, would you like to say a few words about the deceased? connor mead. .was a lot of things to a lot of people. not all of them good things. .but to me he was a great brother. guess it's just me against the world now. no, it's not, paulie. no, it's not. look, it doesn't have to happen like this. it's not gonna happen. nothing you can do about it, dutch. you made your bed, now you gotta bang whatever crawls into it. that's what i keep trying to tell you. what can i say? life, you know, it's like a quick cup of coffee. you haven't got the guts to love someone with all you got. .then you end up drinking alone. no. no, uncle wayne. sorry, kid. party's over. aah! wayne ladies, let's take it away. whoa. no! no! i can change! i swear! no! no! i can change! i swear! i can change! aah! i'm alive. i'm alive! you there, young man. what day is it?

you and paul have something so rare, all right, so powerful. don't chicken out now. chicken out? he cheated. oh, get over it. it was years ago, all right? with some slutty friend of yours. yeah, well, that's true. a friend, incidentally, who you're not even mad at. and you know why? because you don't actually care. you love paul so much, you forgave him the second you heard. and that's what scares you. you have no idea how i feel. you have no idea. yes, i do. i've been in your shoes. you know what? it scared the hell out of me too. what if she hurt me? you know, what if she left me? what if she died? lt'd have been the end of me. so i cut it short, before she ever could. and you know what? it was the biggest mistake i have ever made. you're making that same mistake now. .and i'll be damned if i'm gonna sit by and watch. you gotta risk love, sandra. risk it. i didn't. look at me. i'm an empty, lonely, ghost of a man. it doesn't mean that you're never gonna get hurt. but i can guarantee you this any pain that you feel. .will never, ever compare to the regret that comes from walking away from love. as someone who's felt a lot of both, trust me. pain. .beats regret every day of the week, and twice on sunday. don't run away. don't do it. i can't believe i'm saying this. .but, uh, i think you might be right. so. .you wanna get married?
