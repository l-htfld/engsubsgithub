 with a. with a big gun. oh, my. oh, m. god. at least do it with a little authority. someone's going to think i raised a pussy. you scared the crap out of me. how did you get here? i live in a nursing home, not a prison. they have a shuttle service and a very muscular driver named donald. grammy, i'm making a lot of money right now. i could have sent a car for you. then, i wouldn't have gotten to see a very muscular driver named donald. why didn't you call? i could have been here. oh, my god. our dinner. i have been working so hard, i forgot what day it is. that used to happen to dad. that's what happens when you care about your job. and don't give a rat's ass about your grandmother. well, yeah, that is why i put you in the home. good morning, everyone. before we get down to business, i would like to offer a big welcome back to daniel hardman. we're thrilled to have you home. now, moving on. i'm sorry, jessica. before you do that, i want to say one thing. while i am delighted to be back, i want to be clear. nothing's changing. jessica is still the head of this firm. i'm here in a number two capacity. just think of me like a seasoned advisor. like bill to hillary if she'd won. thank you, daniel. moving on. prescott hospitals' negotiation with their nurses' union. nobody wants a strike. i'm going to need someone who's going to bring this home. therefore. not to jump in here too quick, but i did bring prescott into the firm. i'm your man. what i was going to say is i brought harvey up to speed on this last night. he's got it covered. been prepping all morning. really? the whole morning? i learn fast. maybe i could still help. mind if i take a look? later. jessica likes to keep these meetings headlines only. i'll swing by your office. sounds like a plan. next order of business. nurses' strike assigned to me last night? goddamn daniel. picked up right where he left off. trying to cut my legs out. why are you grinning? i'm just glad to have someone in the room who pisses you off more than i do. you know why i picked you, right? because you knew i'd roll with your lie. because you need a chance to get out of the doghouse. i got your tea service for you. you think that's going to cut it? what do you want me to do? put him in his place. ahh! it's a can opener. what? paying for your sins of last night? i wish you hadn't said that. why not? 'cause i spent the night with my grandmother. is she hot? what is wrong with you? you started it. i most certainly did not. prescott hospital. i need a complete summary of their nurses' union negotiation. from whom? rachel? no. no, it's too soon. i. i broke it off before we even started. no. tell her about the exciting night you spent with your grandmother. trust me. she'll realize she dodged a bullet. oh. and i need four bullshit pro bono cases right now. i don't have any pro bono files. i'm a corporate lawyer. that's what we do here. i do it on my own time. thanks, rachel. wait a minute. why are you asking me for case files? i'm not allowed to say. harvey asked mike, and he was too afraid? like a baby girl. you okay? no. but i am too busy to do anything other than throw myself into this stack of work anyhow. well. as long as you're making healthy choices. yeah. make yourself at home. you know, i can see myself in this thing. i would find that really distracting, of course. i'm swooning. i thought the plan was to meet in your office. i thought i'd save us some time. this is a child custody dispute. little lenny. so sad. you need props to make your point? you said you changed. why don't you prove it by doing some good? harvey, i have changed. but i don't have to prove anything to you. not as long as you sit in this office and pretend to practice law. but when you stick your nose in my cases, that's another story. if you haven't noticed, my name is on the door. they're all my cases. the name of this firm is pearson hardman. you said it yourself, you're number two. i answer to number one. no matter who you answer to, one way or another, you will learn to treat me with respect. fine. i respect you, but i don't work for you. and i sure as hell don't work with you. pick up the phone. little lenny deserves the best. see the money, wanna stay for your meal get another piece of pie for your wife everybody wanna know how it feel everybody wanna see what it's like living in a beehive of your mind me and missus so busy, busy making money all right all that time imagine this the greenback boogie you know the head of the nurses' union isn't a lawyer but a nurse, right? what's your point? what if you get schooled by a hot nurse? what are you, ? what, you can talk about my grandmother, but i can't make a nurse joke? yup. actually, i was when i had my first caregiver fantasy. let me guess. nurse ratched. say what you will. you had a kind of stocky hotness. listen, our goal is to reach a fair agreement between a hospital and its nurses. there are no winners. did you have a stroke? there's always a winner. of course there's a winner. just needed to make sure you were ready to stick it to the nurses. don't say it. ah. negotiator number five. meet the new boss. same as the old boss. jameson was our last negotiator. trust me. i'm not jameson. that's what he said about the one before him. you're all the same to me. i'm over here, you're over here. well, let's see if we can't. you're going to have to buy me dinner first. i can do better. you're expecting me to offer you this. you're willing to settle on this. you're praying for this. well, your prayers have been answered. you know, i'll even buy you breakfast in the morning. not so fast, blondie. prescott hospitals is hurting as much as anyone else. you push any harder, they're going to go out of business, and nobody wins. this is the best you're going to do. and it's a deal you're ready to take. we were ready. but what about the new account you funded yesterday? yeah, that's right. i know about it. this isn't my first rodeo. then you also know that money's off the table. money's fungible. everything's on the table. i'm sorry, but that account was funded by donors specifically for the development of new robotics for surgery. i used to change bedpans for a living, junior. i know what bullshit smells like. this isn't bullshit. even if prescott wanted to give that money to the nurses, they couldn't, legally. so they're willing to raise money for equipment but not nurses? i get it. nurses are sexy, but nurses aren't sexy. well, you need to find a way to get us access to that money, or we don't have a deal. that's not going to happen. well, then we're done. you leave this table, it means only one thing. i know exactly what it means. we have a fully funded strike fund, and we're going to use it. we reject your proposal. reminder ask harold to dye his hair. orange is the color of a clown. no, strike that. harold is a clown. annual survey of associates came out. pearson hardman ranked second to last in quality of life. who beat us? louis, i know you take great pride in making the associates' lives miserable. well, i did until the survey said i was second best at it. you're missing the point. harvard wants to rescind our on campus recruiting privileges. what? wait. pearson hardman is harvard. harvard is pearson hardman. one can't survive without the other. there's no need for histrionics just yet. histrionics? this is the gravest day i've ever known. jessica, let me handle this. why do you think i'm here? screw you. mine likes to be scolded too. i keep getting these dating site pop ups. it's like my computer's accusing me of being single. do you know why it's doing that? my mother's in there? did you search for a dating site? no. when? last week. you, me, happy hour, harvey's corporate card. are you crazy? you want to leave the office at ? oh, don't be ridiculous. happy hour starts at . it's a bad idea. you're never going to get an injunction to stop the strike outright. you read that in a book, or is that what your five minutes practicing law have to say? not a book but every labor decision from the last ten years. but i'm telling you, it's a safer bet arguing for the temporary restraining order. first of all, a t.r.o. delays a strike, an injunction stops it, and i want to stop it. second of all. never use that phrase safer bet with me again. safer bet. you know what? you don't deserve the privilege of seeing me win. i've gathered you all here to ask you just one simple question. do any of you have the desire to strip down and exchange underwear with each other? any takers? no? well, of course not because you don't want to air your dirty laundry in public, right? but evidently, you did. and while i'm personally proud of the fact that you're all unhappy, harvard is not. so i've invited a representative from the law school to see firsthand how joyful you all are under my tutelage. so you want us to lie? no. i want you to convince this woman that pearson hardman makes you shit rainbows. is that clear? yeah. you sure? okay. yeah. anyone else have any other stupid questions? what are you doing here? i'm here on behalf of pearson hardman. as much as i appreciate a fan club, this hearing starts in five minutes, which means you've got four minutes to get out of here. daniel. i'm prepared to rule on your motion. what do you think it's going to be? t.r.o. granted. finally, you rule one for me. don't give me any grief about the feinberg suit. your precedents sucked. this one's legit. it's good to have you back, daniel. thank you for moving me up on the docket, judge. what the hell was that? i believe it was a victory. hey, you don't reschedule my hearings. were you in there? 'cause i do. the truth is you should be thanking me. well, would you like me to thank your face with my fist? if you would have consulted with me first, like i offered, i could have told you. garvin steiner was never going to grant an injunction. not when his wednesday golf buddy shows up and hijacks the courtroom. say what you will. i know the man. chance he gives you what you want. daniel, maybe you don't know how it works these days. when i'm on a case, the only thing there's chance of is me losing. harvey, i said i've changed. don't mistake that change for weakness. i told you, my name's on the door. didn't get there by me taking shit from the likes of you. you want to work together on this, i'm open to it. you don't, this is how it's going to be. so let me get this straight. the judge ruled against your idea, and so you went with my idea? not exactly. hardman got the t.r.o. okay, so you told me i was wrong, and yet i had the same idea as a managing partner. that's funny, that kind of makes me wonder what else you've been wrong about. hiring you? daniel and i wouldn't concur with that. hey, handsome. your bearded buddy was already here. you can shut us down for hours, but we can still prepare to strike. actually, i came over to extend an olive branch. why don't you go ahead and start your strike right now? you looked into our finances, i looked into yours. your strike fund has enough to last a week. we're not even going to have a meeting about it for a month. we know what we're getting into. we're prepared. well, prepare yourself for this our last offer's off the table. the new offer is the one we gave you before that. and every day you strike, it's going to keep getting worse. harvey, you do realize you just littered, right? they can pick it up. they're not working. it'll give them a sense of purpose. wow. you don't think you're being a little harsh? i just put an end to a situation our client can't afford and those nurses can't either. trust me, they'll cave. everyone. i would like you to meet. ms. sheila zass from our beloved harvard law. while i appreciate the introduction, i would have appreciated even more a little discretion. i'm here to make an assessment, which would have been aided by anonymity. fly. wall. loud and clear. and by the way, it's sazs. s a z s. yeah, that's what i said. sheila zass. never mind. do you see what i see? there's two of them. i think louis is attracted to female louis. do you think that if they touch, the world would cease to exist? i don't want to think about them touching. there's my favorite litigation girl. olivia, what's up? james, gordon brief, just going to say, it was a gift to the law. see, this is what i like to do, basically. i like to, uh, you know, sit here once a week, make myself accessible, get to know the troops on a, you know, personal level. okay. and what has that process yielded? well, harold has a mother. aunt. who tragically died of heart disease. cancer. we're all with him. i think i've seen enough. clearly, you don't know that person very well. so unless you want to find yourself recruiting suny binghamton, you'll treat me with a little more respect. wow, you really cut me to the quick. yes, i do not know him on a personal level, thank god. but i don't think that's relevant. i have underlings. i don't know a single person's last name. god, i admire you. what do you need from us to keep our privileges? what do you think i need? talk to each one of them individually. bingo. pick a man. that one. what the hell is wrong with you? people say i'm emotionally unavailable. i got us hours, and you threw it away. no. you gave them two days to negotiate with the threat of a strike hanging over our heads. i took the only bullet they had out of the chamber. and now that bullet is headed right at us. they have an offer in front of them, and they're going to sign it. you don't know that. yes, i do. well, you better be right because if either one of us picks up the phone right now, we'll be the ones who caved. then we might as well tell them they can have everything. finally, we're on the same page. welcome to the team. we're not on the same page. you backed us into a corner. i didn't do shit. nell sawyer put us into that position. i gave her the best offer we could afford. and if this strike drags on, prescott goes down. and none of us can afford that. this strike never would have happened in the first place if i had gotten an injunction instead of the t.r.o. by the way, that piece of genius, same idea my associate had. kid's smart, but he's never been around the block. you have. stop thinking like a rookie. okay, let me guess. the reason that you haven't signed up yet is that you want me to help you take some sexy pictures for your profile. you're hoping that one thing leads to another and. bow chicka bow wow no. the reason i haven't signed up yet is because they have you fill out this form, and it asks you to write down who you are. and who i am is a paralegal. rachel, i am a legal secretary, and i am proud of it. but when somebody asks me who i am, that is not the first thing that comes to mind. yeah, but i don't have anything else, you know? i kidded myself about becoming a lawyer, and i kidded myself about mike. so the truth is i am just a lonely paralegal. and that's a tough thing to write down. well, you're not a lonely paralegal tonight. we're lawyers. pearson hardman. i'm harriet specter, and this is my associate. michelle ross. i've got a photographic memory. pretty much a legal superhero. i'm a closer. i'm the best goddamn closer this town has ever seen. what are you looking at? i can recite the constitution forwards, backwards, and sideways 'cause i read it once when i was seven. i don't buy it. recite it right now. cheers. cheers. i'm a flame thrower. surgeon. acrobat. professor. of law. i'm a rabbi. ooh. ooh. oh, my god. what the hell did you order? uh, you wanted to see me, mr. hardman? please. call me daniel. sit down. first of all, i want to tell you harvey speaks very highly of you. he does? well, it's harvey. so you have to read between the lines. what did he say? that i'm. i'm not a complete idiot? something like that. he also told me that you and i had the same idea to go after a t.r.o. he told me that too. why did you think it was the right move? it put a clock on the negotiations and kept both sides at the table. i thought so too. but whether i agreed with him at the time or not, i'm not going against him now. but he and i do agree on this point his decision puts us in a bit of a pickle. because we can't go back to ms. sawyer and ask exactly what she needs to close the deal. harvey and i can't. but i can. so you are smart. i'm afraid so. you'll have to forgive me for not completely trusting harvey's assessment, but i needed to make sure that our back channel negotiator was up to the task. that's why he's not here. coach doesn't let dad come to the tryouts. what do you need me to do? they sent you? which means they're not serious about talking. ms. sawyer, please. listen to me. you are on strike, and they are never going to flinch. so what harm is there in talking to me? why should i trust you? well, that's why i wanted you to meet me here. nell, this is my grandmother, edith ross. hello. a proud resident of a prescott nursing home. this is not just another case for me. yeah, and he didn't just stick me in here last night to make that point. he locked me in here months ago. grammy. now, easy, michael. i'm helping you out here. by the way, you're a bit of a hero to my favorite nurse. really? well, that's nice to hear. he never shuts up about you. i can't take one pill in peace. edith, i'm glad you brought up the topic of pills because i need to give your grandson a little lesson. you mind? no. let's see here. plavix, zestril, hygroton, atenolol. you know what happens when they're not kept straight? not good. who do you think does that? doctors? nurses. imagine your grandmother's nurse just finished a hour shift. she needs her medicine in exactly two hours. we're understaffed. that nurse is going to stay. he won't even sign a time card for it because he won't get paid. but if his name shows up on this chart, he stayed. happens every day. you ask me what i want? i want enough money, so it never happens again. that one's a dud. you have no idea. mm. ms. sazs. mr. litt. louis. sheila. i feel as though i'm talking to a. kindred spirit? yes. i know. me too. level with me. i'll be brutally honest. that's the only language i speak. i'm going to allow you to maintain your recruiting privileges because of the man i believe you to be. and i believe myself to be that same man. but you've got bigger problems. your associates don't respect you. they think you don't work as hard as they do. what? they think you make them do your work. you realize i'm only telling you this because i think that they're wrong. they are wrong. now, if you'll excuse me. i did it. did what? you and daniel are going to be so proud of me. why don't you let me be the judge of that? judge all you want. judge away because i saw nell on my own, even used my grandmother. not used. she was on board with it. that's weird. maintaining your integrity, i like it. continue. so it turns out that the nurses are consistently staying late to give the patients the right meds even though they're not being paid for it. and you bought that? yeah, i bought that. because i checked my grandmother's chart. if it's true for her, it's true for others. oh, you didn't let me finish. turns out, that all they want is enough staff so that nobody ever has to work more than a hour shift again. and how much is that going to cost? of the new equipment fund. nailed it. so all we need to do is find a legal way to get at that money. yeah, so do you want me to go tell daniel how proud you are of me, or do we do that together later? have, like, a group thing? i'll give him the good news. wash all you want. the lies aren't coming off. i told you i changed. i didn't say i became a nun. you lied to my associate. i never specifically said anything that wasn't true. people hear what they want to hear. you deceived your own. you never lied to anyone else here? jessica, the other partners, me? not since you've been back. really? when did jessica assign you this case? you lied to me. but i didn't come to the bathroom and cry about it. no, you sent my associate to go crying to the other side. so he got us a final number. he got a number, but it's not going to be final. we offer them million, the next day it's going to be million. we needed to hold strong to get them to close. says your gut, and i don't practice law based on your gut. my gut didn't burn through five negotiators. nell sawyer did. so you think we should never budge. i know we should never budge, but you screwed that when you sent mike to tell them we would. congratulations, daniel. we may be a couple of liars, but only one of us is going to be responsible when this whole thing goes to shit. you wanted to see me? we'll get going in a minute. once i start, i have to finish. i've always hated these things. a filthy habit. my daughter was . i caught her smoking, and i hit the roof. but then my wife got sick. and then when the cancer got to her lungs, once a week, we would share a cigarette. give it the finger. monday nights at . i can't stop. i don't want to stop. uh, we should really figure out a way to get at this equipment fund. it's going to be a long night. that's okay. i don't really have much of a social life. me either. barbaric. norma, the scofield subpoena is missing an entire class of subcontracts. please amend it to include anything after . oh, and send sheila a basket of flowers. thank you flowers, not romantic flowers. let things take their natural course. can't you just keep a diary like every other year old girl? not tonight, harvey. just go home. what's going on? nothing. i'm just catching up on some work. in the bullpen? apparently, the associates don't believe that i work as hard as they do. what? louis, anyone who doesn't think you're the hardest working lawyer at this firm is an idiot. you may be a dick, but as far as i'm concerned, the associates have it pretty good. thank you, harvey. dick part aside. remember when we were in here? what we had to do? like it was yesterday. i can still hear hardman reaming me out for losing that dunridge file. you were sitting right here. i was so scared. i thought i'd be fired right on the spot. i hid it. i knew it! i knew it! i had to work hours straight just to recreate it. yeah, but we killed it at trial. yeah, if that happened now, i wouldn't hear the end of it. i know. god forbid they have to pull one all nighter, let alone two. it's like they think there's this law against working more than hours a day. well, there isn't. prima donnas. i should fire them all right now and start from scratch. louis, i'm only going to say this once, so you better enjoy it. you're the man. you're the man. you're the man. harvey, did you say somebody's the man? you're the man. thanks. appreciate it. who's the man? you're the man. you know it. what did you say? you're the man. damn straight. what are you doing? oh, uh, god. i'm sorry. this. this looks awful. i'm working with hardman. he needed a file, and i. why didn't you just send donna? okay. i deserve that. rachel, i swear, i didn't mean to. oh, don't look at me like that. it's not porn. it's match.com. so you're, uh. yeah. i am. that's good. it is. i think it's, uh, good. yeah, me too. except that i have been working on this essay for the past three days, and this is all i've got. it's blank. i know. okay, how about you start with something like this i work at the top firm in manhattan. yeah. see, that's not really. i have an office, which is unheard of for a paralegal. that shows how much they value me. just hold on. okay, more. i'm passionate. funny, tenacious. courageous. any more adjectives? supercalifragilistic expialidocious. i'm incredibly smart, sometimes aggressively so. you realize this is supposed to make me sound good, right? why don't you let me finish? i'm a. i'm also a kind person. and i want someone who notices the little things, like. like the fact that i'm a foodie, and i love to share that with other people. or that when someone pays me a compliment, i can't even look them in the eye, or the fact that my parents are obviously loaded, but i'm still determined to make it on my own. i'm not going to type that last part. hey, it doesn't matter. you're still going to be beating them away with a stick. well, yeah, because you write such a. such a good essay. no, i mean, after you post a picture here. barbinger file, done. scofield subpoena, done. johnson strategy, written. every single one of your assignments was completed by me last night. what else do we have left to do? uh, file it? filing. doc review, spell check. grunt work? yes, grunt work. because that's your job. let it be known that i can do your work faster and better than any one of you without shedding a tear or breaking a sweat, but i don't because writing briefs and recommending arguments is how you learn. you go out to any other firm right now at this stage of your career, you won't have this opportunity. if you don't believe me, i will write you the best recommendation you have ever seen, and you can find out for yourself. go ahead. any takers? that's what i thought. now i have ten new cases here. who wants in? what are you guys waiting for? come and get them. excellent work last night, mike. thanks. whoa, you didn't tell me you were bringing her in. who do you think the proposal was for? does harvey even know about this meeting? as a matter of fact, i do. what's this? it's a pink slip. pink slips, in fact. for nurses. excuse me? it's come to my attention these nurses have been working past their hour shift. and they don't put it on their time card, but they still sign charts, which happens to release them from the protection of federal labor law. you're bluffing. i found these in one night. how many do you think i'll find in a week? there's a way out of this. sign the contract. your grandmother would be proud. you have until the end of the day. harvey! let me guess. you're upset. i got you that information through my grandmother. your idea, not mine. look, i know you might have been hatched in a pod, but family actually means something to me. and i gave you that information to help the nurses, not strong arm them. were you okay with the first deal we presented to nell? that is not the point. that's exactly the point. because this is a contract that our client can actually afford. harvey. enough. you think i was joking when i asked if you were ready to stick it to the nurses? i wasn't. i know you don't like this part of the job, but it's part of the job. if prescott gives in to their demands, they go out of business, the nurses get nothing, it's a win win. that's bullshit. it's a win because you beat daniel. i work with him, i work with you, i work with him. it doesn't take a genius to figure out that you're playing each other, and you're using me to do it. but you know what, i don't care what's going on between the two of you, but i don't want to be caught in the middle of it ever again. grammy, if that's you, i swear to god, i'm going to have the locks changed. rachel. you hurt me. i'm sorry. no. all those nice things you said, those are the kinds of things you say when you. look, if you feel those things about me, why can't you be with me? i told you, you know, it's. it's work and. and that guy. it's everything, you know? i just. i don't think it would work. i think it would be a mistake. yeah, you know what? you did say that. and it's a lot of bullshit because the mike that i know and the mike that i fell for. he wouldn't do this. and if all of your feelings are still there, then it only points to one thing. and it's that you're keeping something from me. i don't want to lie to you. then don't. please, just. just tell me what it is. i thought so. rachel. i'm done. rachel. rachel, wait! rachel! rachel, stop. please, let me explain. how? look, i want to tell you. then tell me. i can't. why? i mean, what could it possibly be? you're. you're married? you're some kind of spy? no, you don't understand. look, once i tell you, i can never take it back. this is my everything. i can't. did you have fun? i wouldn't say fun. you celebrating winning the case or beating me? two for the price of one. jessica loves a bargain. you here for another round? no. i'm not here to start a fight. i'm here to apologize for one. the partner meeting. you were welcoming me back. but i saw you sitting there in my old chair, and i just. i'm sorry. his words sound good. only one problem. you were starting stuff before you even got here. gifts to everyone, digging into cases, constructing a new office. that was all part of coming back. not furnishing it with my tea set. that's what this is about? don't you remember where you got that tea set? alicia gave it to you. and i took it because i missed her. i'm sorry. i thought you would understand that. hey. hey. i need a copy of the final agreement the nurses signed. yup, got it right here. thank you. you look different. new clothes. hair like that. you have a date. good night, donna. good night, rachel. mind if i come in? uh, truth be told, i was taking off for the afternoon. late night? nothing i can't handle. i believe it. i heard your speech to the associates. and i just wanted to tell you how impressed i was. thank you. i always knew you were the right man for the job, so it feels good to see it in action. something wrong? no. louis. if you really heard me in there, you'd know that i give them the chance to rise to the occasion. and i just wish every once in a while, you might maybe do the same for me. you wanted to see me? yeah, mike. sit down. i wanted to tell you a story that i should have told you the day daniel came back. when jessica and i found out that daniel was embezzling from clients, we confronted him. he broke down. he said his wife had cancer, and he needed the money to try and save her life. turns out, he needed the money to support his mistress. now he's saying he's different. but a man who would do that is a man i find very difficult to trust. do you trust me? that's what i wanted you to know. is this your first time? no. i'm just. trying to forget about the other times. start fresh. look, i mean to be rude. i just really want to concentrate. you have three hours to complete the exam. good luck. your time starts now. three times in one week. i might have to write you back into my will. what's wrong?
