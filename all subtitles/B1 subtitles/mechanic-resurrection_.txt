 santos, so good to see you. we saved your usual table, mr. santos. thank you. my pleasure. nice to see you, otto. thank you. five months in brazil. you're a hard man to find. i don't speak english. you even have the accent right. if you say so. i do say so. the principal i represent has an offer for you. he would like three men killed. each death must look like an accident. your specialty, i believe. seems that reports of your demise have been greatly exaggerated. my principal could make that known to certain interested parties. which means that your new life here would end rather quickly. or you can do the job and go back to being dead. what's your pleasure, senor otto santos? let me make a call. what are you doing? tell your principal it never pays to fuck with the dead. get the fuck on the ground! get the fuck down! don't look at me! koh lipe, southern thailand bishop. hello, mei. you're different. older. um, something more than that. i need time to find someone before they find me. then i'll be moving on. who else is here? no one. diving season's over. come. your home's waiting for you. how was your trip? it was okay. it was a busy season. but don't worry, no one came near your home. nothing's changed. get some rest. hi. how can i help you? great, you speak english. um, i'm running low on first aid. i'm staying on a boat. sure. this is all i have. thanks. if i don't have what you need, i can call our supply boat. they can take you back to phuket to get it. no, this is great. thanks so much. anytime. bishop! bishop! they're fighting. it's bad. you want a piece of me? stay down. i've met her. she has a backbone. women like that get killed in these situations. domestic squabble, mei. not my business. you helped me once. help her. or i will do it. hold this. frank, get the fuck away from me! frank! not worth it. bitch. let her go. who the fuck are you? please, help me. i said, let her go. last chance. let go of me, frank. you don't want to do that. fuck you! is he dead? bishop. shit. take her ashore. i'll deal with the boat. okay. bishop. where is she? sleeping. in your bungalow. what's going on? gina thornton. american. that's you, right? yeah. you're the second woman who has my picture in her phone. the first was working for a guy called crain. name ring a bell? the only thing you got right was my name. the first woman was a messenger. is that what you are? so what's the message? i already told you. tell me about crain. what are you supposed to do for him? where is he? fine. i'll talk. look. i don't work for crain. that's the truth. but he did send me. where is he? i don't know. why are you here? he has something on me. i had no choice. right. any of his men nearby? he didn't say, i didn't ask. what about frank? part of the setup. explain. he was supposed to get me, and i escaped to this island. it wasn't meant to be real. but then frank got drunk and attacked me. crain wanted me to look like a victim. and get next to me? yeah. but frank took his part too far. so we meet. what next? i use the cell and call the pre programmed number. let it ring once. after that, i don't know. my new girl gets kidnapped is what. what? the thought didn't cross your mind? okay, so you fall for me, and crain thinks he has leverage on you. why? well, to force me to do something i don't want to do. what is it that you do? i'll make the call, not you. i choose when they come. then i'll take crain out. no. i'm not going to help you kill anyone. do you really believe that crain lets the people he blackmails into helping him live? i've spent my whole life setting people up to die. i can set you up to live. my father was a doctor of eastern medicine. he was a healer. bishop used to study with him. to learn how to heal? a man like him? i thought so, too. but my father understood that those who have been hurt the most often have the greatest ability to heal. eighteen months ago, special military operative gina thornton left the war zone in afghanistan to offer humanitarian assistance in cambodia. after my last deployment, i just needed a change. too many innocent people getting caught in the line of fire. rules of engagement made it impossible to prevent. and then, you know, when i came to phnom penh, i, uh, i don't know, it just felt right here. and, um, i felt like i can maybe do something good with my life. i can't afford any surprises. need to know what crain has on you. i run a shelter for victims of human trafficking in cambodia. there's always been an issue or two, but i've managed to handle it. a few weeks ago, one of my staff members was kidnapped. two days later, she was thrown off a truck at my front door. beaten. died within an hour. crain sent this asshole, jeremy, who said it was just a taste of what he'd do to everyone at the shelter. including the children. they are my weakness. all the leverage crain needed. so, you see, i didn't have a choice. i had to do what crain wanted me to. what are you doing? hold my hand. it's for crain's people. they're watching. where? two men in a zodiac. out in the ocean. there you are. come on, you two. you're gonna miss the best part. give me your hands. hold this, please. we can just get a drink and. no, you will not. you will stay right there. mei. thank you very much. what are you doing? all couples have to be tied together. but we're not a couple. you sure looked like it on the beach. so, um, do you go to weddings a lot? not my idea of a good time. me neither. here. we supposed to drink this? no. put your fingertips in it and place three dots on each other's foreheads for good luck. enjoy. i could use some good luck. enjoy ? okay, my turn. come on, let's just get a drink. leave that. all right. one second. this is a great look for you. you missed a spot. it's really kind of stuck. okay, okay. next time, use your shoe. i love this song. this a thai song? yeah. it's so good. wanna dance? no, don't worry. i don't. i don't want to dance with you. what, you think i'm a bad dancer? you look like you're a terrible dancer. hey. i, um, just wanted to thank you for everything. everything? and i wanted to apologize for getting you into this mess. those kids are everything to me. if they get trafficked or. or killed. .i couldn't bear it. i understand. i was an orphan, too. i was sold to an east end gangster who specialized in training child soldiers. crain was there, too. what happened? i escaped, he didn't. no doubt they blamed him. took it out in blood. so now he blames you. yeah, this is his payback. oh, god. i'm so sorry. it's not your fault. what are we gonna do? i worked it out. supply boat from the back side of the island, out of view. by tomorrow night, you'll be out of danger. your kids, too. it's all arranged. what about crain? i'm not doing his three kills. once you're safe, there's only going to be one. him. but they'll never let you near him. they'll never know i was there. i want you to hold on to something for me. until i come back. my father gave this to me. it's the only memory i have of him. i'll keep it safe. that's crain's guy. look at me. remember, i'll make sure they get you home. trust me. bishop! bishop! help! go! bishop! bishop! mr. crain, i have him right here. tell me how to find you face to face. are we done? follow me. sit down. please, don't move. i'd listen to her if i were you, arthur. no need for guards or guns when the man you want's sitting on a pound of semtex. how did you find me, riah? what, no, hello. nice to see you after all these years ? but then, you always were one for getting down to business. how did i find you? you should know better than anyone, arthur, there's no privacy anymore. not with wonderful things like facial recognition and satellite tracking. i'm going to give you something i never give anyone, chance to walk away. give me the girl and walk away. i see you've developed a sense of humor over the years. but if it's all the same, no, i need you. you're the best. open it. i need you to eliminate three people. and this is the first. his name is krill. mass murderer and warlord. he's also the highest profile arms dealer in africa. he's imprisoned on penjara kaedah in malaysia. his imprisonment is what keeps him secure. it's impossible for his enemies to get to him. and this? it's important that you swallow it only after the kill, or the fuel cell will degrade and we'll never find you. where's gina? do the three kills, arthur. get the girl back. even if you don't love her, you at least owe her, no? i mean, she's in this shit because of you. how do i know you'll keep her alive? finish your kill, get a video call. after the last one, you'll receive instructions where to find her. and your word's good, is it? good heavens, absolutely not. but i do have a very keen sense of self preservation. i know that cheating you will only make me your target. and since that concludes our business for the moment, i wish you bonne chance. let's get moving, sweetheart, come on. come on, let's go. the prison is miles out to sea, set atop cliffs more than meters high and surrounded by shark infested waters. so, basically impossible to get in, and nobody has ever gotten out. it will be even harder to get your man. he's surrounded at all times by his team of loyal soldiers. getting him alone will be your main challenge. shark repellent. yes, sir. thank you. it's powerful stuff. hope you know what you're doing. hey! hey, you! what? what? what do you want, huh? hey, stop. yeah, right. stop. fuck you. martin basman, you are under arrest. line up! go. go. thank you. keep going! bishop, remember, it has to look like an accident. if he dies with a knife in his back, no one will be there to pick you up. good luck. who the hell is that? krill. he was an executioner for people like charles taylor and the sudanese militia. people say he ate the hearts of his victims. some have relatives who want revenge. like that guy over there. he used to be krill's best assassin. now all he wants to do is kill him. but he has his bodyguards constantly protecting him. you are a good man. why don't you join us for dinner? i'm not sure i like the company. then they are not invited. hey. come, come. come in, my friend. there are six murders and stabbings every week in this shithole. most of them pointed at me. that guy you stopped, he used to work for me. oh. maybe he is still upset that i killed his brother. loyalty is a scarce commodity in my line of business. oh, yes. how did you know that he would want to kill me? i hear things. my juju tells me everything that i need to hear. maybe you weren't listening hard enough. do you know who i am? krill. you run this place. exactly. and when i get out of this place, i'm going to run all of africa. there could be a job for a man like you. i already have a job. what job? you. let the man pray. here he comes. he's right below us. bring up the net. nothing in the net, sir. what the fuck? looking for someone? i want my call. well, bishop survived. hello, arthur. happy now? nice work on krill. prison food'll kill you. put gina on. here's your boyfriend. hi. how are you holding up? i'm okay. crain wanted me to let you know that, um, you have hours to eliminate the next target, or they will eliminate me. that won't happen. okay, this is all very sweet, arthur. but you heard what she said. you need to pick up the pace. this is your next kill. adrian cook. did bishop tell you where he got this? it belonged to his father. i never saw him take it off. never. you know, i wasn't sure there was anything in the world that could break arthur until i saw you wearing this watch. now i know he'll do anything for you. sydney, australia in the heart of downtown sydney, atop a story high rise, is the penthouse suite owned by adrian cook, the mining and minerals billionaire. few people know that he originally made his fortune in human trafficking, specializing in underage sex workers. he has plenty of manpower protecting him, of course. but that's the least of it. there you go. the sydney opera house and the harbour bridge. cook's paranoia is only trumped by his ego. exhibit a. his cantilever pool. the walls and floors are all concrete, three feet thick. every door is made of six inch nickel chromium steel. that's like armor plates. and the biometric sensors and retina readers at the access points are impossible to hack. it's a fortress in the sky. mr. clark. good to meet you. shall we? so each apartment has over square meters of premium living space. but this one gets the sydney sunset. the specifications are all in the brochure. let me show you the detailed floor plan. we've got italian tiles running completely across here. oh, excuse me. sure. hello? samantha burns. hello? sorry about that. so, where were we? you were about to tell me about the floor plans. oh, yes. but we're not dumping on the reef. near is not on. and if the tree huggers do kick up, well, then. yeah. that's right. now i've gotta go. now i've gotta go. everyone, evacuate! billionaire adrian cook plunged floors to his death this morning, when the glass pool of his sydney penthouse collapsed. although authorities. give him his call. okay. .described his death as a tragic accident, effectively ruling out foul play. ready. go ahead. bishop, your watch stopped. i think it's a sign. maybe it just needs cleaning. no. look closer. son of a bitch! all right? this the harbor master's office? yeah, it is. how may i assist you? my name is tom silva. some bastard in a bloody gray yacht just scraped my vessel. uh, i have the hull number, but, uh, my insurance needs the owner's details. okay, mate. go ahead. wrx . okay. give me one moment. the vessel's berth is in sydney harbour on pier . that's about it. if you need any further details. the boat you're looking for is gone, mate. it's a big one, too. head out of the harbor. it couldn't have gone far. it's your money, boss. there! east! come out of the sun, so he can't see you. drop it down to feet and hold it steady. got it. i'm heading aft deck. hey! take him out! go. go, go! bishop! you know your problem, bishop? you just can't help yourself. that's how i knew you'd come back for her. that's your weakness. now do the third kill, or the girl's dead. take him down below. and give him a proper sendoff. varna, bulgaria bishop, if you pull another stunt like that, our deal is off, and you'll never see your little girlfriend again. now playtime's over. go to the port town of varna, on the black sea. that's where you'll find your third kill. his name is max adams, a wealthy american arms dealer. on the north side of varna, you'll find a truly vulgar memorial to bulgarian communism. adams spent a fortune restoring it and putting in the most comprehensive security system. but the interesting part is what you don't see. hidden in the mountainside below is the sub pen. adams stocks his u boats with intercontinental ballistic missiles. nobody gets in or out. many have died trying. so, needless to say, this will be the hardest site to penetrate by far. on top of all that, krill and cook's deaths may have adams on the defense. you have hours. you're using me to take out the competition. st. augustino hospital emergency ward. we will dispatch a helicopter. once you reach the compound, you'll have to deal with several layers of security. zone six clear. the building has its own power system, oxygen supply, and a state of the art panic room. good luck, arthur. open the goddamn door. please? call me when you know something. no sign of the intruder, mr. adams. that's because he's sitting right in front of me here in the safe room, jackoff. magnificent. even if it is all stolen and looted. cubo futurist totalitarianism. of course it's magnificent. like, uh, dinosaur bones. it's ugly. who the fuck are you? i'm here to talk. lose your cell phone? i should've hired those guys from houston. all right, what is it that you want to talk about? i want to help you avoid an accident. krill, cook, that was you. i warned those guys that one day crain would come after all of us. cappuccino? espresso? espresso. no sugar. krill was a warlord, but also the number one arms dealer in africa. cook used his mining empire as a cover to control the asian franchise. you have got europe and most of south america. north america, too, if you count mexicans. that didn't leave much for crain. so i have a deal for you. hmm. well, i'm a dealer. we can talk about it. i've been called a lot of ugly names over the years, communist, socialist, racist, fascist. none of which is true, of course. well. .i'm certainly not a communist. you just admire their architecture. i believe in fair play. i saw the david and goliath story play out on the frontlines of vietnam. soviets in afghanistan. ethnic cleansing in bosnia. chemical weapons on the kurds. the little guy is always gonna need a slingshot, and somebody's always gonna pay for it. an arms dealer with a moral clause. mmm hmm. let's talk about crain. we both need him gone. the question is, how do we accomplish that? he's got an army around him. we need something tempting enough so that crain uses his men to go after it. what do you have in mind? your submarine pen. have them search for weapons, treasure. your corpse. what? you'll have to die. well, that's easy. although it will cost a tremendous amount of money. you can afford it. are the boats all secured? yes, sir. batteries charged? yes, sir. fully provisioned? yes, sir. you get those russian girls in here last night for the crew? yes, sir. well, looks like we're ready to go. stay here. there was an explosion, and mr. adams fell into the water. his security, they tried to reach him, but the rocks came down, and he was buried under the water. gone. oh, my god. i never imagined that dying would be so goddamn invigorating. stay out of sight for two days. after that, you can invigorate all you want. you calling for the driver? making dinner reservations? checking in with mom? i'm calling crain to make sure he takes the bait. you do know how to put on a show. there's a pier a few miles north of varna. be there tomorrow with the girl. not until i see adams' body. you'll find him with his most prized possessions. in his submarine pen. get over there. find adams' body. secure everything inside the pen. and, uh, what about bishop? kill him. jeremy, point the camera forward, so i can see. all right. let's go. fan out. where the hell is bishop? sir, it's clear. clear. contact right rear. take cover! take cover! take cover! go, go, go! motherfucker! anything? no sign of him, mr. crain. stay sharp. bishop's coming. you can count on it. what's going on? your boyfriend's coming to die. and you're the bait. move! come on, bishop. i know you're not going to let her die. nothing here. yeah, we're clear. bring her to the bridge. let's move. let's go. we have three minutes before it blows. gina. you okay? i'll be fine. let me see. oh, shit. i saw crain doing something on the console. what's going on? crain is trying to kill us. let's go. move this shit on the boat, now! yes, sir. what is this? just get in. wait. what are you doing? making sure you live. no! come with me! bishop! there he is! bishop! find him. now! move! fletcher! let's get going. you never asked why. i know why. 'cause i got out, and you didn't. and here we are again. you deserted me. it's time you paid for that. no chance. you're gonna get your third kill. but this one won't look like an accident. you're a dead man, bishop. you might get off the boat, but you'll never swim far enough away before she blows. who said i was swimming? bishop! bishop! bishop! hey! hey! were there any survivors? no. that's the anchor compartment. nothing more out there. so bishop never made it. even legends die. phnom penh, cambodia dear mei. i'm back in cambodia with the kids. the water filter's working. thank you so much for your generous gift. you have to come here someday. i think you'd like it a lot. bishop would have loved it. see you soon. i hope. lots of love, gina. clever son of a bitch. sneaky bastard. bang. you're dead
