it's incredible, you can find any place from anywhere. listen to me, we can find out how fast passenger trains went back then. we take that speed, multiply by the hours that you were on the train. that's it! we create a search radius. and inside there, you will find the station with the rain tank. yeah, but it will take a lifetime to search all the stations in india. did i say all the stations? ok, even half the stations. really guys, i don't want to talk about this. did your parents try to find you? what? they tried to find him. no i just mean like, if they tried to find him, maybe they left like a paper trail. what paper trail?

what if you do find home and they're not even there? and you never stop and keep searching? and you don't know what happens over time, things change, and entire worlds change. i don't have a choice. stay. i can't. stay right there weren't you supposed to look after him? where were you? don't you love him? john heard mantosh is out on the boats. doing a lobster run. he's due back tomorrow. so he'll be flushed with cash, back on the hard stuff. i'm sorry you couldn't have your own kids. what are you saying? we. we. weren't blank pages, were we? like your own would have been. you weren't just adopting us but our past as well. i feel like, we're killing you. i could have had kids. what? we chose not to have kids. we wanted the two of you. that's what we wanted. we wanted the two of you in our lives. that's what we chose. that's one of the reasons, i fell in love with your dad. because we both felt, as if. the world has enough people in it. have a child, couldn't guarantee it will make anything better. but to take a child that's suffering like you boys were. give you a chance in the world. that's something. i bet you never imagined it being this hard. it's not a matter of hard. it's not a mat. there's only one path for me. and, that's how i think. that's how this happened because. when i was , i had a vision. some people would say, it was a breakdown. but it. my dad was an alcoholic. you know that, and he was like he wasn't a good man. he was out of control when i was. i was standing at the back of the house. i was looking out across this field. and i just wanted the earth to swallow me up. and i. i felt an electric current, it was like a shock, like a jolt through my whole body. and then i saw. a brown skinned child across that field. and he was standing beside me. and it was right there and i could feel it so strongly. and for the first time in my life i felt something good. i felt good. and i knew it was guiding me. and i knew that i was going to be fine. it was, as if, that moment i could see my future, right there! because i always thought that i could keep this family together. and now. now i don't know. where. mum. what's happening? i don't understand. you don't talk to me any more. i need you, saroo. mantosh! sorry for what i said at dinner. ganesh talai. ganesh talai. ganestlay! mum i found home! what? please wait for me. i'm here. so this is where you've been. i don't want you to feel, i was ungrateful. there wasn't a day, i didn't want to tell you. saroo. i really hope she's there. she needs to see how beautiful you are! hey hi, i used to live here. i. used to. can i help? that's me. i'm saroo. i used to live here. you lived here? yes i used to live here. i'm looking for guddu, kallu, shekila. my mother. come. come where? come with me. just come. saroo! mum. mum? saroo? saroo? saroo. saroo! saroo! oh, how i looked for you! i'm sorry. i'm so sorry. yes, the watermelon. watermelon tarabuja! yes, tarabuja! watermelon. guddu? and guddu? where is guddu? where is he? guddu is no more. he is with god. shekila. shekila shekila shekila? shekila? shekila? shekila? he's your brother! she's so big! it's me, saroo. beautiful. hi, mum. i know you will be sound asleep. i just want to say that i'm safe. i'm safe and the questions have been answered. there are no more dead ends. i found my mother, and. she thanks you both for raising me. she understands that you are my family. she's. happy, just knowing i'm alive. i found her, but that doesn't change who you are. i love you mum. so much. and you, dad. and mantosh
