mrs. cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children, they are his? huh? oh. yeah, yeah. one for sure. after all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the assets based on one act of indiscretion. seven. pardon me? seven single acts of indiscretion. seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of and all of which he himself is responsible for. he is? mrs. cole. you're the victim here. the wife of a cold, distant workaholic. starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man! seven. yeah, whatever! you're not trying to deny him what is rightfully his. all you're insisting on is what is rightfully yours. yeah. and maybe a. fraction more. i think you're bending over backwards. yeah. i did offer to give him joint custody of the kids. he is, after all, a wonderful father. and how does he repay you? by dragging you through a painful litigation process! no, no, no, no! this can't happen! with all due respect, this isn't about you and mr. cole anymore. this is about all women. where would tina turner be right now if she'd rolled over and said, hit me again, ike, and put some stank on it? rolling on the river, that's where she'd be. but she's beyond thunderdome, because she decided to send a message. wake up, sisters! there's no such thing as a weaker sex! you know what? you're right, mr. reede. i am tired of getting kicked around! good for you! thank you. i am so grateful to have an attorney i can trust. oh, you are good. you are very, very good. the cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm. if you win, i guarantee you'll make partner. in fact, how would you like to make a partner right now? oh, i don't know. i should. happy, happy, happy happy, happy, happy happy i'm so happy today i live in the usa so honey? have you thought about. you know, what we talked about? yeah. i can't go. what? why not? because of max. but he'll love it there. i'm gonna take him to fenway park. there's hiking and camping. well, really, it's. fletcher. fletcher? come on, honey. he wouldn't even come over unless you reminded him. i know, but when he does come over, max is so happy. it's like they have their own little world together. the gipper and i have that too! i know, but it's different. how? well. he does the claw. the what? the claw. you know, it's like this. i don't. run for you life. it's the claw! the claw! i can't really do it that good. that's not the point. the point is if they're , miles apart, they're never gonna see each other. fletcher's never gonna come to boston. hello. audrey? fletcher! where are you? we're waiting. max won't cut the cake until you get here. oh, man! actually, something has come up. i've. i've got this problem on a new case. what happened? nothing! i stubbed my toe on the desk! i'm really sorry, but i just can't make it. the boss is, uh, really riding me. fletcher, it's his birthday! i know, i know. i'll make it up to him, i promise. i'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?

now i'm telling the truth. and last night you weren't. no. well, what were you doing? having sex! well, i hope that it was with someone very special. no! that's the thing. i don't even like her, but she's a partner. i thought i could help my career by making her squeal. what's wrong with me? i'm getting what i deserve. i'm reaping what i sow. i'm. is dad still picking me up? no, max, he's not. i'm sorry, but i'm gonna pick you up, okay? i'll work it out. i guess my wish didn't come true. what wish? i wished that for just one day dad couldn't tell a lie. max? i have something important to talk to you about, okay? okay. okay. hello? audrey! let me explain. something has happened to me. well, something else is about to happen to you. max and i are moving to boston. what? jerry has asked me to marry him, and max and i are going this weekend to look at houses. i thought it was semi serious! it's just been given a violent shove into serious. you can't move to boston, i'll never see max! you'll have the same relationship you have with him now, won't you? where are you? i'm going home. when you get there, just stay there. i'm coming over. we have to talk. fletcher! i'll be right there. hey, mr. reede. fletcher. holy hell! you can run, but you can't hide. what's your problem, schmuck? i'm an inconsiderate prick! oh, shit! shit! you know why i pulled you over? depends on how long you were following me! why don't we take it from the top? here goes. i sped, i followed too closely, i ran a stop sign, i almost hit a chevy, i sped some more, i failed to yield, i changed lanes without signaling while speeding! is that all? no. i have unpaid parking tickets. be gentle. audrey! wait! wait, audrey. hold on. wait! wait. i just had an insight into myself. i'm crazy. you call and say, wait, i'll be right over, and here's the crazy part, i actually wait. i can explain this. i have missed a department meeting. did you come in a cab? yes! where's your car? thank you! i can't tell you how much this means to me. i can. , . . how do you sleep at night? i'm taking this. you scratched my car! where? right there! oh, there. that was already there. why, you. you liar! you know what i'm gonna do about this? what? nothing! because if i take you to court, it'll drain eight hours out of my life, and you won't show up, and if i got the judgment, you'd just stiff me anyway! so i'm gonna piss and moan like an impotent jerk and then bend over and take it up the tailpipe! you been here before, haven't you? well, i can't remember when i've had more fun, but if you'll excuse me, i have a class. are you marrying this guy because you're mad at me? no, i divorced you because i was mad at you. wait. i want to talk about this! what do you want to say? is this guy right for you? he is so not me! that's one of his best qualities. but he's kind of a magoo. i'm sorry. you're wrong. sometimes maybe he is a little. magoo! yes. but since we've been going out. my god, i'm not having this conversation with you. audrey, you can't go. this is not fair. fair? okay, let's define fair. last night a year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. fair? last night. was none of my business. thank you. none of my business. two years ago, it was my business. but i don't have to care anymore. that's the magic of divorce. but it matters to max! everything you do matters, and everything you don't do. all right. now let me tell you something. i'm a bad father! i mean. i'm a bad father. you're not a bad father, when you show up. what if i come right after court and play ball? then you and i can talk before you make any rash decisions! no, we are leaving tonight. please, audrey. give me one more chance. i'm throwing myself on the mercy of the court. i lost you, but please don't make me lose max, too. give me a chance to be the father i started out to be. you're really coming? this is ironclad. this is the mother of all promises. what time? okay, . . all right. all right. but if i tell max that you're coming, and you don't show up and i have to see that look on his face, that heartbreaking look, we're going to boston. if i don't show up, i'll pack you myself. i will lovingly wrap your nicknacks with bubble paper. i hope so. do you know what your son was doing at last night? he was making a birthday wish that for just one day his father couldn't tell a lie. oh, my god! that's it! i do not like them, sam i am. i do not like green eggs and ham. would you like them here or there? i would not like them. excuse me. hi. i'm max's bad father. i'm his father. dad! could i borrow him for just one second? monster max! you came to play catch? i'd like to, but i can't. i gotta talk to you. your mommy told me about that wish you made last night. it came true, max. really? you mean you have to tell the truth? yes. no matter what? no matter what! is wrestling real? in the olympics, yes. on channel , no. will sitting too close to the tv set make me go blind? not in a million years. if i keep making this face, will it get stuck that way? uh uh. in fact some people make a good living that way. now listen, max. you've gotta do something for me. i need you to take back that wish. so you can lie? yes. but not to you. you see, max, sometimes grownups need to lie. it's hard to explain, but if. look, here's a good example. when your mommy was pregnant with you, she gained pounds, there was nothing she wouldn't eat. and daddy was scared. but when she'd ask me, how do i look? i'd say, honey, you look great. you're glowing. if i had told mommy she looked like a cow, it would have hurt her feelings. understand? my teacher tells me real beauty's on the inside. that's just something ugly people say. max, no one can survive in the adult world if they have to stick to the truth. i could lose my case, i could lose my promotion, i could even lose my job. now, i need your help, max. okay. okay. do whatever you did last night, only this time, make it an unwish . i did it. excellent! now, i just need a little test. did it work? not like i'd hoped. did you unwish it? only. what? only what? yesterday, when i wished it, i really meant it. this time when i unwished it, i only did it 'cause you told me to. all right. do it again. and this time, mean it. but i can't! why not? 'cause i don't want you to lie. i explained this. i have to lie. everybody lies. mommy lies. even the wonderful jerry lies. but you're the only one that makes me feel bad. max, recess is over. come on in! mom says we're moving to boston. that isn't for sure yet. she promised we'd talk about it tonight. i am coming! you believe me, don't you, max? i'll see you later, buddy. fletcher. how's it hanging? short, shriveled and always to the left. boss, it's skull. he knocked over another atm. this time at knife point. he needs your legal advice. stop breaking the law, asshole! boss, are you all right? my son hates me. max loves you. i've seen you together. you're his hero. oh, yeah? last night at his birthday party, he made a wish that i wouldn't be able to lie for one whole day. kids. it came true. what? max's wish! it came true. boss, maybe you should just take a few days off. greta! didn't it seem weird to you that i kept telling the truth all morning? well, yeah. but. what are you saying? that you are incapable of lying? that's right! i am incapable of lying! just for today? apparently. 'til tonight. it's one of those hour curses. those are going around. you don't believe me, do you? of course not. how ironic! okay. ask me something you think i would normally lie about. all right. remember a couple of months ago when i wanted a raise? i don't want to do this. and the company wouldn't give me one and i asked if you would give it to me out of your own pocket. and you said the company would not allow it, because it would create jealousy among the other secretaries. was that true, or did you just not want to pony up the dough? greta, please! judge stevens, hi! fletcher reede. i'm scheduled in your court in half an hour. judge stevens, i badly, badly need a continuance. ill? am i ill? that is the perfect question for you to ask. please lie for me! i remember when you bought me this antique frame from tiffany's. tiffany's? garage sale. . , marked down from ten. i'll give you the raise! here's your raise. hi, judge stevens! i know i haven't given you an answer. but illness could mean so many things. can you hold? hello? mom! hi! i wasn't really on vacation. because i didn't want to talk to you! because you insist on talking about dad's bowel movements, size, color, frequency! i'll call you later! hello? oh, damn it! i cut him off. i cut off the judge! greta! don't leave! i'm on my knees in a suit! mr. reede. several years ago, a friend had a burglar on her roof. he fell through the skylight, landed on a butcher's knife, cutting his leg. the burglar sued my friend. he sued my friend! because of guys like you, he won! my friend had to pay the burglar , . is that justice? no. i'd have got him , . goodbye, mr. reede. no, wait! i didn't understand! ask me again! have a nice day in court. greta! hi. god in heaven! it's nice to see you too, fletcher. are you busy? extremely. good. would you follow me, please? did you know that the partnership committee is headed by mr. allan himself? you used to work directly for mr. allan. yeah. tell me. what do you think of him? he's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard! a belligerent old fart! a steaming pile of cow dung! figuratively speaking. really? how delightful. this way. pardon me for interrupting. mr. allan, you remember fletcher reede? oh, yes! nice to see you again, fletcher. i'll be observing you in court this afternoon. i've been hearing some good things about you. well, fletcher has just been telling me how much he thinks of you. why don't you tell mr. allan? well, what do you think of him? he's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard! a belligerent old fart. a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. figuratively speaking. that's the funniest damn thing i've ever heard! you're a real card, reede! i love a good roast! do simmons! simmons is old! he should have been out years ago, but he can't stay home 'cause he hates his wife! you've met her at the christmas parties. she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard. and you, tom. you're the biggest brownnose i've ever seen! you've got your head so far up mr. allan's ass, i can't tell where you end and he begins! priceless! you have bad breath caused by gingivitis. you couldn't get a porn star off. your hairpiece looks like something that was killed. i don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off and bury it in lime! loser! idiot! wimp! degenerate! slut! i like your style, reede! that's what this stuffy company needs! a little irreverence! good! i'll see you later, dick head! dick head! priceless! keep your eye on that boy. dick head! third district court is now in session. the honorable judge marshall stevens presiding. afternoon, counselors. are we ready to begin? no, sir! we are not ready to begin because my client has not arrived! hurry up! move it, move it! here she comes to wreck the day mr. reede! sorry, your honor. go, go, go. lupe, you keep those kids quiet. i'm not even close to kidding. sorry. billy threw up in the car. you brought your kids to your divorce? sympathy. well, it's working. i feel sorry for them already. miss appleton, you may begin. from march through june i surveilled mrs. cole at the behest of mr. cole. during that period, i noted that mr. cole left each day between and . thereafter mrs. cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay from one to four hours. i was able to take several photographs of the male visitor. i see. do you know what mrs. cole and her male visitor did during these frequent visits? well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn, but i was able to make a recording of one such session. your honor, as you are aware, under the terms of the prenuptial agreement, if mrs. cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. with your permission, we'd like to play the following tape recording. here comes big daddy! ohh, god! do it to me! do it to me! harder! harder! oh, come on! your honor, how can it be proved that the male voice on that tape is not mr. cole himself?

your honor, would the court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break? can't it wait? yes, it can. but i've heard that if you hold it, it can damage the prostate gland, making it very difficult to get an erection! is that true? it has to be. well, in that case, i better take a little break myself. but you get back here immediately so we can finish this. how am i going to get out of this? think. think. think! what the hell are you doing? i'm kicking my ass! do you mind? i found him like this in the bathroom, your honor. somebody beat the hell out of him. who did this? a madman, your honor! a desperate fool at the end of his pitiful rope! what did he look like?

hey, how you doing? i've slipped into the seventh circle of hell! thank you. you? shouldn't we be going over our testimony right now? basically, the plan is, i walk you through the tape. step by step, i ask you questions. and we give the explanation you came up with. exactly. all we gotta do is lie. that sounds simple enough. doesn't it! then i'll finish up with dramatic questions. something like, mr. falk, isn't it true that you and mrs. cole have never made. oh, god! i can't do it. i can't finish the question if i know the answer is a lie. you may proceed, mr. reede. respondent calls. kenneth falk. raise your right hand. do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god? i do! i mean. i do. mr. falk. do you know my client, samantha cole? yes. isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic? i object, your honor! to yourself? yeah. but i would like to rephrase the question. mr. falk, would i be accurate if i described your relationship with mrs. cole as totally professional? i object, your honor, and i move to strike! mr. reede, i don't know what you're on, but you better get to the point and quick. thank you, sir. is your relationship with my client entirely platonic? not! is not your relationship with my client, boink! bad baby, bad baby! did you ever not make. did you. mr. reede! you had sex with her every time you met, didn't you? didn't you! liar! he's badgering the witness. it's his witness. you slammed her! you dunked her donuts! you gave her dog a snausage! you stuffed her like a thanksgiving turkey! all right, it's true, okay! i humped her brains out! there! now you happy? no further questions. no questions. you may step down. do i dare ask you to call your next witness? i have no further witnesses, your honor. what are you doing? call me! you do not understand. i can't lie. i can't do anything dishonest until tonight! listen, you bastard! i want my money! i am not going to end up a year old divorcee on welfare because my scumbag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! thirty one? if mr. reede has no further witnesses, then i have no choice but to rule in favor of. your honor! i call samantha cole to the stand. order. order! order! knock it off! sit down! mr. reede, it is out of sheer morbid curiosity i'm allowing this freak show to continue. mrs. cole if you dare. mrs. cole, is this a copy of your driver's license?

overruled. mrs. cole, answer the question. . now let me get this straight. that would mean that you lied about your age to make yourself older. but why would any woman want to do that? i changed it so i could get married. and the truth shall set you free! my client lied about her age! she was only when she got married, which makes her a minor, and in the great state of california, no minor can enter into any legal contract without parental consent, including. prenuptial agreements. prenuptial agreements! this contract is void! the fact that my client has been ridden more than seattle slew is irrelevant. standard community property applies, and she is entitled to half of the marital assets, or . million! jordan fades back. swoosh! and that's the game! nothing further, your honor. order. order. order! in light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor of mrs. cole. yes! she is hereby awarded half the marital assets. the son of a bitch pulled it off! i didn't know! it doesn't matter. the contract's void. order. order. i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. is that correct? yes. yes. no. i'm contesting custody. what? if i get sole custody, that's another grand in child support payments. you just won million! hey, i'm the victim here. you said it yourself. now i'm gonna hit him where it hurts. but you. you said he was a good father. so? well, mr. reede, do we have an agreement on custody or not? no. i see. in that case, there will be a custody hearing on the th at a. m. court is adjourned. come on, let's go. daddy! you stop that whining, or i'll give you something to whine about! i wanna go with daddy! come here, kids. come on. it's all right. don't you worry. i promise we'll be together, whatever i have to do. it's okay. it's okay. oh, for god's sake, will you give me those?

we're adjourned, mr. reede. your honor, i think we've made a big mistake. mr. reede, i am tired and very cranky. i know, but this is just. wrong, isn't it? i manipulated the system. just because you bought it doesn't mean i'm right. it's a technicality! young man, having my judgment mocked in my own court is not something i'm prepared to tolerate! well, tell that to the kids when they're adopted by the manson family! one more word out of you, mr. reede, and i'll hold you in contempt! i hold myself in contempt! why should you be any different?
