you're clowning. you're not clowning? i sense clowns. people react to news of late stage cancer differently. there are certainly options we can look into. new drugs are being developed every day. so what do we do? surely there is something we can do. my uncle ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. and there were all these new experimental drugs from germany. wade vanessa's already working on plan a, b, all the way through z. me? i'm memorizing the details of her face. like it's the first time i'm seeing it. or the last. doctor mr. wilson. mr. wilson? take your time to process this. it's important not to do anything rash. now, if i were a pound sack of assholes named francis, where would i hide? oh. wade a hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation wade w. wilson. out of regina, saskatchewan, lines up the shot. his form looks good. oh! and that's why regina rhymes with fun. ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing. is sweet dick kicking revenge. oh! giving him the business. incoming! this is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level! looking good, francis. well rested. like you've been pitching, not catching. ringing any bells? no? how about now? wade fucking wilson. francis well, hello, gorgeous. wade yeah, like i got bit by a radioactive shar pei. yeah. and whose fault is that, huh, francis? yeah, time to undo what you did to this butterface. please, you should thank me. apparently, i made you immortal. i'm actually quite jealous. yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it? now, i'm about to do to you what limp bizkit did to music in the late s. dad? wade i think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way. well, maybe not the most. wade uh. this is my most prized possession. vanessa wham? no, no, no. wham! make it big is the album that george and andy earned the exclamation point. so, am i supposed to just smile and wave you out the door? think of it like spring cleaning. only if spring was death. god, if i had a nickel for every time i spanked it to bernadette peters. sounds like you do. bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere. drink. you're right. cancer is only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. all things i can live without. ha. you belong here at home. surrounded by your voltron and your bernadette, and your me. listen, we both know that cancer is a shit show. like, a yakov smirnoff opening for the spin doctors at the iowa state fair shit show. and under no circumstances will i take you to that show. i want you to remember me. not the ghost of christmas me. well, i wanna remember us. i swear to god, i will find you in the next life. and i'm gonna boom box careless whisper outside your window. wham! no one is boom boxing shit. okay? we can fight this. besides, i just realized something. you win. your life is officially way more fucked up than mine. i love you. wade. weas. you look like you need a blow job and a shower. though courtesy calls for the latter first. how about three shots of patron? or how about triticum aestivum, wheatgrass. excellent for the immune system. jesus christ. you sound like vanessa. here, check it out. she's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures. i'm sure they're all fda approved. chechnya. isn't that where you go to get cancer? you got china and central mexico. you know how they say cancer in spanish? no. el cancer. oh. i could have guessed that. look how happy you look here. mind if i keep this? put it up, so i can remember when you looked alive. at least now i'm gonna win the dead pool. now that you're gonna die tragically of cancer. i got it, weas. thanks. oh. and, uh, that guy over there came in looking for you. real grim reaper type. i don't know. might further the plot. boothe. wade. mr. wilson. how can i help you? besides luring children into a panel van. i understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. stalker alert. it's my job. recruitment. i'm sorry you've had such a tough go. but you're a fighter. special forces. confirmed kills. one every seven weeks. same rate most folks get a haircut. hmm. it's to wash the taste out. it's tough to forget being so impressive. and now you spend your days sticking up for the little people. people change. what do you want? i represent an organization that may be able to help. what if i told you we can cure your cancer? and what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of? i'd say that you sound like an infomercial, but not a good one, like slap chop. more shake weight y. the world needs extraordinary soldiers. we won't just make you better. we will make you better than better. a superhero. look, agent smith, i tried the hero business and it left a mark. but if i ever hit fuck it, i'll look you up. oh, um. shit. we're within yards of a school, so you may wanna. his drink's on him. weasel what did he say? vanessa hey, what's going on? hey. sorry. i had a liam neeson nightmare. i dreamt i kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it. hey, uh, they've made three of those movies. at some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent. hmm. wade the worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you. but what it does to the people you love. who knew if this guy could save my life. but i knew there was only one way that i could save hers. isn't that what superheroes do? wade okay. let's pro con this superhero thing. ow. pro they pull down a gaggle of ass. local dry cleaning discounts. lucrative film deals, both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies. con they're all lame ass teacher's pets. you know, i can hear you. i wasn't talking to you. i was talking to them. stay right here. colossus you've been warned before, deadpool. this is a shameful and reckless use of your powers. you will both be coming with us. wade look, colossus, i don't have time for the goody two shoes bullshit right now! and you are? negasonic teenage warhead. negasonic teenage. what the shit? that's the coolest name ever! so, what, you're like, uh, his sidekick? no. trainee. let me guess. x men left you behind on what? shit detail? what does that make you? pretending you're not here, negasonic teenage warhead. can we trade names? can we go? wade look! i'm a teenage girl. i'd rather be anywhere than here. i'm all about long sullen silences. followed by mean comments, followed by more silences. so what's it gonna be, huh? long sullen silence. or mean comment? go on. you got me in a box here. aha! we can't allow this, deadpool. please, come quietly. you big chrome cock gobbler! colossus that's not nice. you're really gonna fuck this up for me? trust me, that wheezing bag of dick tips has it coming. he's pure evil. besides. nobody's getting hurt. that guy was already up there when i got here. wade, you are better than this. join us. use your powers for good. wade heads up. be a superhero. wade listen! the day i decide to become a crime fighting shit swizzler. who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners at the neverland mansion. of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker. on that day. i'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend request. but until then, i'mma do what i came here to do. either that or slap the bitch outta you! colossus wade. hey. zip it, sinead! hey, douche pool! and i hope you're watching. quite unfortunate. that does it! oh! canada! that's not good. colossus wade, please. wade cock shot! oh, your poor wife. you really should stop. all the dinosaurs feared the t. rex. wade i promise this gets worse for you, big boy! this is embarrassing. please, stay down. wade you ever hear of the one legged man in the ass kicking contest? do you have off switch? yeah, it's right next to the prostate. or is that the on switch? enough! colossus let us go talk to the professor. mcavoy or stewart? these timelines are so confusing. dead or alive, you're coming with me! colossus you will recover, wade. you always do. you ever see hours? spoiler alert. oh, my god. nasty. wade oh, there's the money shot, baby. are you there god? it's me, margaret. wade rock, meet bottom. and when life ends up breathtakingly fucked. you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision. the one that sent you down the road to shitsburgh. this? well, this was mine. agent smith mr. wilson. nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's. you finally hit fuck it. just promise you'll do right by me. so i can do right by someone else. of course. and please don't make the super suit green. or animated. man move it! keep moving. this place seems sanitary. my first request is warmer hands. oh! and, jesus, a warmer table. we should really come up with a safe word, fellas. i'm thinking pork and beans. easy. aren't you a little strong for a lady? i'm calling wang. what's up with the matches? oral fixation or just a big stallone fan? patience, angel. all in good time. are you here for the turndown service, or what? we have another talker. i'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp. shut the fuck up. mr. wilson, my name's ajax. i manage this workshop. ah, my welcome speech used to be full of euphemisms like. this may hurt a little. this may cause you some discomfort. but i've grown blunt. this workshop is not a government led program. it's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself. into men of extraordinary abilities. but if you think super human powers are acquired painlessly. wrong. i'm injecting you with a serum. that activates any mutant genes lurking in your dna. for it to work we need to subject you to extreme stress. you've heard that whole make an omelet, break some eggs bit, right? i'm about to hurt you, wade. i was a patient here once myself, you know. the treatment affects everyone differently. it made angel inhumanly strong. in my case, it enhanced my reflexes. also scorched my nerve endings, so i no longer feel pain. and, in fact, i no longer feel anything. thanks! thank you. thank you. you have something in your teeth. right in the middle there. just, i don't. a little nugget of romaine lettuce or something. it's been bothering me for a long time. ah, made you look. hey, is ajax your actual name? because it sounds suspiciously made up. what is it, really? kevin? bruce? scott? mitch? the rickster? in british accent is it basil fawlty? oh, joke away. one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor. we'll see about that. i suppose we will. he's all yours. oh, come on. you're gonna leave me all alone here. with less angry rosie o'donnell? francis this is how it's going to work. adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum. so we're going to have to make you suffer. francis if you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion. francis if not, well, we'll have to keep on hurting you. in new and different ways, each more painful than the last. until you finally mutate. or die. cunningham you mean a bucket list? wade like a fuck it list. i'd really like to light a spliff off the olympic torch. cunningham pass it to me right after. let's not forget naked tandem base jumping with the wnba's sacramento monarchs. anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity. finally, giving meredith baxter birney a dutch oven. no. receiving a dutch oven from meredith baxter birney. making banana pancakes for my kids. vanessa. wade i wanna see vanessa. francis you're lovely. i don't know about anyone else, but i'm touched. we were just joking. no, no. it's okay. i encourage distractions. wouldn't want you giving up on us, now would we? hey, don't take any shit from him, cunningham. how tough can he be. with a name like francis? francis? wade that's his legal name. he got ajax from the dish soap. f, r, a, n, c, i. oops! snagged the dry cleaning tag off your lab coat. fyi, i could probably get you the superhero discount. you are so relentlessly annoying. thanks. never heard that before. why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up? or i'll sew your pretty mouth shut. oh. i wouldn't do that if i were you. see, here's the problem with round the clock torture. is that you can't really step it up from there. is that what you think? if this doesn't unlock your mutation, then, well. nothing will. now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air. to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating. if your brainwaves slow, meaning you're about to pass out. then we'll turn up the o . if your heart rate slows. meaning you're able to catch your breath. we'll turn it back down. and that's where we'll leave you. right there. oh, and i thought you guys were dicks before. francis you know the funniest part of this? you still think we're making you a superhero. you. a dishonorable discharge. hip deep in hookers. you're nothing. little secret, wade. this workshop doesn't make superheroes, we make super slaves. we're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder. who knows what they'll have you doing? terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters. maybe just mow the occasional lawn. what the fuck is wrong with you? you're never going home after this. now there's a brave face. wait, wait! wait. wait. seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now. enjoy your weekend. weekend ? back up. weekend? wade did i say this was a love story? no, it's a horror movie. francis fucking hell. looks like someone lost his shot at homecoming king. what have you done to me? i've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation. you sadistic fuck! i've cured you, wade. now your mutated cells can heal anything. it's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form. yeah, i've seen similar side effects before. i could cure them. but where's the fun in that? now, i'm gonna shut you in again, wade. not because i need to. because i want to. oh, well. go ahead. oh, you smell like shit. whoa! angel dust motherfucker. hey, hey, hey. it's all right, it's all right. i think we owe him that one, yeah? you take off. go on. off you go. quick question. what's my name? didn't think so. wade sorry, francis. my lips are sealed. men screaming in the distance you don't want to kill me. i'm the only one who can fix your ugly mug. what's my name? cunningham wade. wade i didn't just get the cure to el cancer. i got the cure to el everything. but there was only one thing. that really mattered. woman come on, let's go. woman oh, that must hurt. thank you so much. indistinct conversations continue god, he's so fucking gnarly. woman look at his face. man oh, my god. poor guy. female pedestrian honey, don't stare. male pedestrian freak. no way. i'm not making her life as ugly as mine. come on, wade, it can't be that bad. ah, bullshit! i'm a monster inside and out. i belong in a fucking circus. wade, vanessa loves you. she doesn't care what you. oh! oh. do you like what you see? no. you look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado. yeah. not gently. like it was hate fucking. there was something wrong with the relationship. and that was the only catharsis that they could find without violence. and the only guy who can fix this fugly mug. is the british shitstick who ran the mutant factory. and he's gone. poof! yeah, well you gotta do something to remedy this. because as of now, you only have one course of action. damn straight. find francis. star in horror films. what? star in your own horror films. because you look like freddy krueger face fucked a topographical map of utah. here's what i'm actually gonna do. i'm gonna work through his crew until somebody gives up francis. force him to fix this, then put a bullet in his skull. and fuck the brain hole. i don't wanna see that or think of it again. but the douchebag does thinks you're dead, right? yeah. that's good. you should keep it that way. what, like, wear a mask? yes. a very thick mask. all the time. i am sorry. you are haunting. your face is the stuff of nightmares. like a testicle with teeth. you will die alone. i mean, if you could die. ideally, for others' sake. that'll do. all you need now is a suit and a nickname. like wade the wisecracker. or scaredevil, mr. neverdie. oh, shit. what? i put all my money on you and now. i just realized i'm never gonna win the, uh. dead pool. captain deadpool. no, just. just deadpool, yeah. just deadpool. to you, mr. pool. deadpool. that sounds like a fucking franchise. this shit's gonna have nuts in it. where's francis? wade where's francis? al seltzer water and lemon for blood. or wear red. dumbass. wade don't make me ask twice. where. is francis? he made me ask twice. is the mask muffling my voice? where's francis?
