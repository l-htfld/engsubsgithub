i don't see a rational discussion to be had from that, do you? word to the wise we're gonna have our hands full when he gets back from his hunt. t dog i was scared and i ran. i'm not ashamed of it. andrea we were all scared. we all ran. what's your point? i stopped long enough to chain that door. staircase is narrow. maybe half a dozen geeks can squeeze against it at any one time. it's not enough to break through that not that chain, not that padlock. my point dixon's alive and he's still up there, handcuffed on that roof. that's on us. i found you, didn't i? i love you, dad. i love you, carl. i found you both. lori yeah. thunder rumbling i knew i would. you're getting cocky now, a little bit. no. no, i knew. walking into our home, finding an empty house, both of you gone. i'm so sorry. i knew you were alive. how? the photos were gone, all our family albums. chuckles i told you so. now you're getting cocky, huh? a lot. it belongs in here. baby, i really thought i would never see you again. i'm so sorry. for everything. i feel like when you were in the hospital, i just i wanted to take it all back the anger and the bad times. but the mistakes maybe we got a second chance. not many people get that. i wondered where that went. do you want it back? of course. rain pattering he won't wake up. thunder rumbling bugs chittering kids playing people chatting morning. man morning. hey. hi. carol morning. morning. they're still a little damp. the sun'll have em dry in no time. you washed my clothes?

why don't you take that stupid hat and go back to on golden pond ? i've been tracking this deer for miles. gonna drag it back to camp, cook us up some venison. what do you think? do you think we can cut around this chewed up part right here? i would not risk that. sighs that's a damn shame. i got some squirrel about a dozen or so. that'll have to do. oh god. come on, people. what the hell? it's gotta be the brain. don't y'all know nothing? merle! merle! get your ugly ass out here! i got us some squirrel! let's stew em up. shane daryl, just slow up a bit. i need to talk to you. daryl about what? shane about merle. there was a there was a problem in atlanta. he dead? shane we're not sure. he either is or he ain't! no easy way to say this, so i'll just say it. who are you? rick grimes. rick grimes, you got something you want to tell me? your brother was a danger to us all, so i handcuffed him on a roof, hooked him to a piece of metal. he's still there. hold on. let me process this. you're saying you handcuffed my brother to a roof and you left him there?! yeah. grunts hey. watch the knife! shouts, grunting shane okay. okay. you'd best let me go! nah, i think it's better if i don't. daryl grunting choke hold's illegal. shane you can file a complaint. come on, man. we'll keep this up all day. i'd like to have a calm discussion on this topic. do you think we can manage that? do you think we can manage that? shane hmm? mmm. yeah. daryl panting what i did was not on a whim. your brother does not work and play well with others. it's not rick's fault. i had the key. i dropped it. you couldn't pick it up? well, i dropped it in a drain. if it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't. t dog well, maybe this will. look, i chained the door to the roof so the geeks couldn't get at him with a padlock. it's gotta count for something. hell with all y'all! just tell me where he is so's i can go get him. lori he'll show you. isn't that right? i'm going back. sighs so that's it, huh? you're just gonna walk off? just to hell with everybody else? i'm not saying to hell with anybody not you, shane lori least of all. shane tell her that. she knows. shane well, look, i i don't, okay, rick? so could you just could you throw me a bone here, man? could you just tell me why? why would you risk your life for a douche bag like merle dixon? daryl hey, choose your words more carefully. no, i did. douche bag's what i meant. merle dixon the guy wouldn't give you a glass of water if you were dying of thirst. rick what he would or wouldn't do doesn't interest me. i can't let a man die of thirst me. thirst and exposure. we left him like an animal caught in a trap. that's no way for anything to die, let alone a human being. so you and daryl, that's your big plan? oh, come on. you know the way. you've been there before in and out, no problem. you said so yourself. it's not fair of me to ask i know that but i'd feel a lot better with you along. i know she would too. that's just great. now you're gonna risk three men, huh? t dog four. huffs my day just gets better and better, don't it? t dog you see anybody else here stepping up to save your brother's cracker ass? why you? t dog you wouldn't even begin to understand. you don't speak my language. dale that's four. it's not just four. you're putting every single one of us at risk. just know that, rick. come on, you saw that walker. it was here. it was in camp. they're moving out of the cities. they come back, we need every able body we've got. we need em here. we need em to protect camp. it seems to me what you really need most here are more guns. right, the guns. wait. what guns? six shotguns, two high powered rifles, over a dozen handguns. i cleaned out the cage back at the station before i left. i dropped the bag in atlanta when i got swarmed. it's just sitting there on the street, waiting to be picked up. ammo? rounds, assorted. lori you went through hell to find us. you just got here and you're gonna turn around and leave? dad, i don't want you to go. to hell with the guns. shane is right. merle dixon? he's not worth one of your lives, even with guns thrown in. tell me. make me understand. i owe a debt to a man i met and his little boy. lori, if they hadn't taken me in, i'd have died. it's because of them that i made it back to you at all. they said they'd follow me to atlanta. they'll walk into the same trap i did if i don't warn him. what's stopping you? the walkie talkie, the one in the bag i dropped. he's got the other one. our plan was to connect when they got closer. these are our walkies? yeah. so use the cb. what's wrong with that? the cb's fine. it's the walkies that suck to crap date back to the ' s, don't match any other bandwidth not even the scanners in our cars. i need that bag. okay? all right. truck beeping rumor is you have bolt cutters. maybe. t dog yeah, we get to that roof, we'll need to cut that chain and the handcuffs. i never like lending tools. the last time i did and yes, i am talking about you let's just say your bag of guns wasn't the only bag that was dropped. my tools got left behind with merle. rick we'll bring your tools back too. think of the bolt cutters as an investment. sounds like more of a gamble. what do i get in return? rick what do you want? how about one of those guns you bring back? my pick. done. man clears throat dale, let's. sweeten the deal a bit. now that cube van of yours what about it? the rv's radiator hose is shot. that's a problem if we need to get somewhere and wanna get very far. and the hose on that van is just about a perfect match well, enough that i can make it fit. i'll tell you what we get back, you can strip that van down to the bare metal. truck honks come on, let's go! thank you. hey, rick, got any rounds in the python? no. last time we were on the gun range, i'm sure i wound up with a few loose rounds of yours. you and that bag like the bottom of an old lady's purse. i hate that you're doing this, man. i think that it's foolish and reckless. but if you're gonna go, you're taking bullets. i'm not sure i'd want to fire a shot in the city, not after what happened last time. that's up to you. well. four men, four rounds. what are the odds, huh? well, let's just hope that let's just hope that four is your lucky number, okay? thank you. all right. truck starts, revving hey. sniffling you know, i bet they'll be just fine. i'm not worried. are you? yeah, a little. don't be. why? think about it, mom. everything that's happened to him so far nothing's killed him yet. chuckles daryl he'd better be okay. it's my only word on the matter. i told you the geeks can't get at him. the only thing that's gonna get through that door is us. brakes squeak gear shift clicks engine stops we walk from here. lori dale. have you seen carl? shane took him down to the quarry. there was some mighty bold talk about catching frogs. women chatting carl i'm not getting anything. yeah. being all wily, staying submerged. little suckers, they know something's up. that's what's going on. just going to have to do this the old fashioned way. all right, little man, look. you are the you are the key in all this, okay?
