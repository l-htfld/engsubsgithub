 it is also about understanding how to navigate a complicated relationship between those who give care and those who are in need of it. if you find yourself lost, frustrated, confused, you can always come back to this helpful mnemonic device aloha. ask, listen, observe, help, ask again. the fundamentals of caregiving are to give care. but not care too much. if you truly want a lasting career in caregiving, you'll need to adhere to the caregiver commandments. writ these down. they're important. i cannot take care of another unless i first take care of myself. ben. ben, come on. i know you're in there. my needs are equal to the needs of the person to whom i am giving care. caregiving is difficult. all i can do is try my best and maintain a positive attitude. congratulations, you're a certified caregiver. just always remember aloha. ask, listen, observe, help, ask again. nothing less. nothing more. you must be mr. benjamin. elsa conklin. hi. i was transferred to the states about nine months ago, and we've yet to find a permanent caregiver for trevor. the transition's been difficult, to say the least. the flight over was the first time he'd ever been on a plane and. well, let's just say, he's never really been one to relish being outside of his house, let alone , feet in the air, or here in another country. so, tell me, why'd you choose to be a caregiver? i like helping people. do you have clients at the moment? this would be full time. no. can you tell me about some of your previous clients? trevor would be my first client. oh. i'd asked them to only send people with experience. oh, um. no, i have the certificate. i took the. it's a six week course. yeah, i've taken it. it's all right. it's just that i specified that we. hello. i'm sorry. you know, i'm so sorry. did i do something wrong? i put on aftershave this morning. that's something i don't normally do. is he sensitive to smells? trevor, that's enough. pick a number between one and , . wha.? huh? it's a game. pick a number. three. nope. two thousand, four hundred and sixty four. sorry, no job. trevor, this is ben. do you have any actual questions for him? what kind of aftershave are you wearing? trevor. what? this guy thinks retarded people get upset by aftershave. that's brilliant. how does that work, exactly? is it, like, oh, no. the smell. i don't understand where it's coming from. please, somebody help. you're not retarded. and don't use that word. people worse off than you, you know? that's true. like retarded people that are forced to wear aftershave. sorry. my child has a unique sense of humor. do you have kids? no. i know i don't have any experience, but i took the course and i'll work very hard. i. i've been out of work for a while and i could really use this job. yeah, but if we're gonna throw down nine bucks an hour for somebody to wipe my ass, we need somebody who knows how to wipe an ass. tell me, ben, given the opportunity, how exactly would you wipe my ass? you're being rude. i think it's a reasonable interview question, given the scope of the job. true or false? this man has to wipe my ass. i'd wipe it in such a way that when i was done, there would be no shit left on your ass. he's the one. hey. hi. did you bring them? ben, did you bring the divorce papers? oh, you know what? uh, i never got them. i know you got them. i shoved them under your door. right, i got your message about that. that's weird. i don't. here's a new set. here's a pen. all right, well, i'll take these home and, uh, i'll read them. why are you doing this to me? do i have to get a court order? i mean, is that really what you want me to do? i'm not ready, janet. it's been two and a half years. what's the magic number where you wake up and you're finally ready? six years? eight? eighty? i'm sorry. i'm just not ready. hello. come in. hi. i'll take you on the tour. what do you know about dmd? um. uh. duchenne muscular dystrophy. when you get home tonight, google it. yes, i. i work as the office manager in a bank. it's a big bank, but i work in a small branch, which means if i'm late, they notice. i have to leave here at , which means you have to be here at . you're late, i'm late. i can't be late. no one else to pay the bills. every day we stretch his hamstrings, heel cords, it bands, hip flexors, and forearms on the bed. i'll demonstrate that for you. he sleeps most nights with the c pap machine to help his breathing. trevor's extremely tied to his routine. it cannot be disrupted. if it's disrupted, he'll have a panic attack. he wakes at the same time every day, he watches tv at the same time every day. he eats at the same time every day. once a week, he goes to the park on thursdays. always on thursdays. always from to . exactly to . he only eats waffles and sausage. two waffles, one sausage. breakfast, lunch and dinner. not ideal, but it's a battle i'm done fighting and the vitamins fill in the gap. hey. check her out. oldest working family farms in jerome, idaho. would you tap that? because i would pound that shit into the ground. his medications are also on a precise schedule. it's all in this notebook. prescription meds, deflazacort, losartan, eplerenone. those you absolutely can't miss. then the supplements, protandim, haelan, omega fatty acids, calcium, vitamin d, co q , creatine, glutamine, quercetin, multi vitamin, and mega green tea. why don't you read the notebook and we'll talk more thoroughly later. statistically, trevor probably has another seven to ten years. so, let's do everything right, okay? i need to hear you say okay. yes. okay. absolutely. trevor, it's his first day. please don't make him cry. you need anything? i do, actually. could you call the make a wish foundation and tell them i want a blowjob from katy perry? i mean, she kind of has to say yes, right? think about it. if she was to reject me, that would a pr nightmare for her. it'd be a shit storm. what do we have here? a two story outhouse. aha. here we go. idaho falls, idaho. two story outhouse. i'm no expert. i definitely think i'd prefer to be on the upper level. he apparently. what is this gem, you ask? this is a map of your precious country's lamest roadside attractions, odd museums, bizarre landmarks, and of course anything giant, from farm animals to cherry pie. what's the red star? that, my friend, is the world's deepest pit. my favorite. it just sounds so depressing, i love it. pick a number between one and , . go on, ben. we've got some time to kill. one and , . three. one . you're not even trying. but i have some fantastic news, i need to take a dump. why is that fantastic news? because it's your time to shine. let's go. ow. i need to take a shit, come on. come on, be serious. take my legs. how does it make sense to take my legs? are you gonna drag me to the toilet? put them down. you all right? yeah. hold on, hold on. do you wanna just shit in your chair, maybe? maybe. ben. ben, it's jammed. ben, help! who do you think would win in a fight to the death. me or a bird? help me! help me! help! how about me versus a lot of birds, but all the birds also had muscular dystrophy? i think a bunch of big birds with muscular dystrophy are fucking you up. i enjoy this time together. me too. can i ask you a question? what? if you woke up and you were totally. fine. what's the thing you'd wanna do most? if i could do anything at all? i'd really like to take a pee standing up. yeah, it's pretty awesome. bye. if somebody tries to rob the bank today, don't be a hero. i can't promise anything once the adrenalin kicks in. fair enough. did you arrange these to look like large testicles and a small penis? yep. brilliant. enjoy your breakfast. thanks. you never told me what you did before you got into the ass wiping business. i was a writer. no, you weren't. really? yeah. i wrote a couple of novels you've never heard of. you're right. so, what is this? is this, like, research for you? hardly. i'm retired. you're retired. right. well, man, you should write about me. well, that would make for a really interesting read. chapter one, watches tv. chapter two, eats waffles. chapter three, watches tv, then eats waffles. it writes itself. seriously, i'm your man. and when you do write about me, i want you to describe me as handsome and cool. the best stuff is truthful. ben benjamin? i have something for you. hey, wait! this is a court order! i know where you live! you're just in time. the hot chick is on. and today i'm going to visit with rufus, the world's. if i had one night with her, i swear when i was done, she wouldn't be able to walk properly. oh, because you'd give her muscular dystrophy? cute. rufus weighs , pounds. hey, check it out. world's biggest bovine. ritzville, washington. ritzville. that's not far from here. what if we saw some of these places for real? have you been working with lead based paint in an enclosed area? come on. don't you get bored just sitting in this room and going to the park once a week? i mean, doesn't any part of you want to see the world's deepest pit in person, not just on tv? i do. but if we're making bucket lists, i'd put that way behind nailing the seattle seahawk cheerleaders in a pyramid formation. i do hope that's televised. embarrassing. all right. so, we go to a seahawks game. you know, most disabled people don't just sit in their houses all day. they get out and do things like everybody else. you got a letter. what are those? letters. from my father. i didn't realize you had a father. i was born, wasn't i? it means i have a father. no, i know, but. he left when i was three. right when i was diagnosed. probably just a silly coincidence. oh. sorry. can you feel the love tonight? well, i sure can. it's valentine's day. and what more of a romantic place to spend it than here in devil's lake, north dakota. so, you don't even read those? really? we're still going on about this? sorry, it's just. i. i don't know. aren't you even curious? i mean, it seems like he's reaching out. i used to read them. they're lame. do you ever write back? no, i have not written him back. does he say he's sorry for leaving? what's with you today? he made his choice when i was three. it was his choice, not mine. he can live with it. let's leave it at that. i'm just saying, you know, he is still your father, maybe. he's not still my father. okay? a father is supposed to be there for his kid. protect him from harm. that's the only job a father has. you don't have a kid, so what would you know about it? this combination of meals is simply. there we go. now go get me some juice. hey, juice. come on. we're not paying you to sit on your ass. mr. benjamin! mr. benjamin! mr. benjamin, i'm not gonna leave! thank you for staying. ever since i started, they've been begging me to go to happy hour on thursday. i finally relented, just to get them off my back. i won't be too late. oh, it's fine. trev's napping. oh, there's another thing. work's asked me to go to atlanta for a week for a training seminar. oh. why don't i stay here with trev? thank you. um. there's one more thing. you know, over the years, trevor's never become attached to any caregiver. i'm so pleased you two get on so well, but. you won't be here forever. i know about your son. you know, i wouldn't let you be with trevor without first doing my due diligence. what do you know exactly? everything. so does trevor. i'm so sorry, ben. i can't even. trevor knows what happened? yeah. three years is not a very long time, and i can only guess at your emotional state. i can't have you getting too close to trevor. i can't have you making promises you can't keep. aloha, right? ask, listen, observe, help, ask again. nothing more, yeah? sounds like my very obnoxious ride. you knew about my kid and you said all that father bullshit to me? huh? you think because you're in a wheelchair that gives you the right to say and do whatever you want? you ever considered that maybe i'm just a prick, with or without the wheelchair? fuck you. and fuck your wheelchair. and fuck your waffles and your stupid fucking map with all the places that you're never ever gonna fucking see. fuck those letters that you'll never reply to 'cause you're such a self absorbed piece of shit. is that the best you can do? that's it? i thought you were a writer. fuck this, fuck that. that's really lame. i think you need a second draft. i don't buy any of your bullshit. you can make jokes all you want, but you are wasting your life by sitting in this house and watching tv. yeah? and what the fuck are you doing? it's been three years, ben. should you really be wiping my ass for an hour? sounds like you and trevor had quite a night last night. yeah, sorry about. i specifically warned you about the nature of your relationship, didn't i? yeah, you did, but. what makes you think i would ever let you take my son on a road trip? and now if i don't let him go see the world's deepest pit or biggest cow or whatever, he's gonna be upset. but of course i can't actually let him go. look, well, whatever. when ben burst into my room and said we should go on a trip, it just seemed like it would be fun. you know? so, just forget it. well, it's not happening. and i resent being put in this position. honestly, what were you thinking? i was thinking it would be good for him. good for him? do you have any idea what traveling with someone like trevor entails? you lose his deflazacort, then what? or the c pap breaks in the middle of nowhere? that be good for him? he's never been more than an hour from his house. maybe it's time to change that. look. it takes three or four days to get to the world's deepest pit. right? we can see a lot of these other roadside attractions along the way. two days to get back, we're gone for a week. i chart out all the hospitals along the way. and they'll lend me the van so we can carry all of trevor's machines and stuff. we can go while you're in atlanta. you're suggesting i risk my son's life so he can see a hole in the earth? i'm suggesting that your son gets out of the living room. right. when i get back from work, we're gonna sit down and plan this to the t. wait. what? well done. that was very heroic how you jumped in there without missing a beat. but i'm sorry, i can't do it. why? this is your idea. i know, but i think i was caught up in the moment. that moment being you telling me to go fuck myself repeatedly. this is great. the open road. you know what? i'm gonna call the make a wish foundation and i'll get katy perry to meet us at a motel in missoula. what song do you want her to sing while she's doing you? fireworks. did you get the van serviced? the van is serviced and ready to go. when? everything's up to date. meaning you got it serviced specifically for the trip, or you got it serviced at the normal time it was supposed to be serviced? i want a text or a phone call every three hours. hey, do you know when he got the van serviced? let's call this off. okay. he needs this. do you need this? i don't need this. he says he doesn't need this. elsa, i won't let anything happen to your son. i love you. he died trying to see the world's deepest pit is a really bad obituary. or is it? okay. what are you doing? it's all right. it's all right. here. i got you. i got you. i got you. look. the road is all about living the dream, my friend. what are you talking about? what are you doing? what are you doing? you are gonna pee standing up. no, no, no. honestly, it's not gonna work. it's a mistake. it's gonna work. all right? no, no, no. it's fine. i got you. give me a sec. i've got you. shh. shh. shh. it is okay. oh! stop for a second. stop for a second. i can't stop. grab your penis! i am! i've got my penis! that's holding your penis?
