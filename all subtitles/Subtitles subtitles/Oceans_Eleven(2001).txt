from chicago? yeah. it's nice there. you like it? yeah. that's wonderful. get in the goddamn house. gentlemen, the block of las vegas boulevard. otherwise known as the bellagio, the mirage and the mgm grand. together, they're three of the most profitable casinos in las vegas. let me see. this is the vault of the bellagio. it's located below the strip. .beneath feet of solid earth. it safeguards every dime that passes through. .each of the three casinos above it. we're gonna rob it. smash and grab job, huh? slightly more complicated than that. well, yeah. this is courtesy of frank catton, a new blackjack dealer at the bellagio. okay. bad news first. this place houses a security system rivaling most nuclear missile silos. first, we have to get within the casino cages, which anybody tell you takes more than a smile. next, through these doors. each of which requires a different six digit code changed every hours. past those, lies the elevator. and this is where it gets tricky. the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications. which we can't fake. and vocal confirmations from. both the security system within the bellagio and the vault below. which we won't get. furthermore. the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors. meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped. now, once we get down the shaft, though, then it's a piece of cake. just, two more guards with uzis and. .the most elaborate vault door ever conceived by man. any questions? rusty no, tunneling's out. there are sensors monitor the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. if a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. anyone else? virgil you said something about good news. danny yeah. the nevada gaming commission stipulates that. .a casino must hold in reserve enough cash, to cover every chip at play on its floor. that means on a weekday, by law, it has to carry anywhere. .between and million in cash and coin. on the weekend, between and million. on a fight night. .like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're robbing it. million, without breaking a sweat. now there are of us, each with an equal share. you do the math. exactly. saul i have a question. say we get into the cage, .and through the security doors there. .and down the elevator we can't move. .and past the guards with guns, .and into the vault we can't open. without being seen by cameras. oh, yeah. sorry, i forgot to mention that. yeah, well, say we do all that. we're just supposed to walk outta there with a million in cash on us. .without getting stopped? yeah. oh. okay. danny all right. here's how we'll begin. first task, reconnaissance. i want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. from the rotation of the dealers. .to the path of every cash cart. i wanna know everything about. .every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. security so, i'm seeing this girl charmaine, i wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee. security she dances at crazy horse too, to pay for medical school. i think she really likes me. cool. danny most of all. i want you guys to know these casinos. they were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. i want you guys to know the quick routes out. virgil he went through at . turk . get a watch that works. you make me sick, dude. it's . no. it's . danny second task, power. on the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. basher, it's your show. basher you want broke, blind or bedlam?

no. then it's definitely a black bag job. they employ an in house technician? two. and one of them is lonely. thanks, charmaine. i'll have it back within the hour. say hi to your mom for me. say it yourself. she's on stage in five minutes. bellagio casino turk watch it, bud! virgil who you calling 'bud', pal?

hang on a minute, hang on. we could use a pinch. what's a pinch? a pinch is a device which creates like a cardiac arrest for any broadband network circuitry. better yet, a pinch is a bomb. now but without the bomb. see, when a nuclear weapon detonates, it releases electromagnetic pulse. .which shuts down any power source within its blast radius. that tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon use to destroys everything you might need power for anyway. but, see. a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the fuss of mass destruction and death. so instead of hiroshima, you'll be get. .the th century. how long? about seconds. could a pinch knock out the power of an entire city? like, for instance. las vegas? yeah, i think it might. now, but there's only one pinch in the world big enough to manage it. danny where?

may i ask how you expect to leave? you believe i'm gonna allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors? no. you're gonna carry it out for us. and why would i do that? take a closer look at your monitor. as your manager's probably reporting to you now, you have a little over million. .in your vault tonight. you may notice, we're only packing up about half that. the other half we're leaving in your vault, booby trapped, as a hostage. you let our million go, and you get to keep yours. that's the deal. you try and stop us, we'll blow both cashloads. mr. benedict, you can lose million tonight secretly or you can lose million publicly. it's your decision. hi. make the call. dispatcher emergency response. where's danny?
