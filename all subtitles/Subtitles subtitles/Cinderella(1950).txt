 here, in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, cinderella. although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still, he felt she needed a mother's care. and so, he married again, choosing for his second wife a woman of good family, with two daughters just cinderella's age, by name, anastasia and drizella. it was upon the untimely death of this good man, however, that the stepmother's true nature was revealed. cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous of cinderella's charm and beauty, she was grimly determined to forward the interests of her own two awkward daughters. thus, as time went by, the chateau fell into disrepair. for the family fortunes were squandered upon the vain and selfish stepsisters, while cinderella was abused, humiliated, and finally forced to become a servant in her own house. and yet, through it all, cinderella remained ever gentle and kind. for with each dawn, she found new hope that someday her dreams of happiness would come true. well, it serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams. yes, i know it's a lovely morning, but it was a lovely dream, too. what kind of a dream? can't tell. 'cause if you tell a wish, it won't come true. and, after all. a dream is a wish your heart makes when you're fast asleep in dreams you will lose your heartaches whatever you wish for you keep have faith in your dreams and someday your rainbow will come smiling through no matter how your heart is grieving if you keep on believing the dream that you wish will come true oh, that clock. old killjoy. i hear you. come on, get up, you say. time to start another day. even he orders me around. well, there's one thing. they can't order me to stop dreaming. and perhaps someday. the dreams that i wish will come true no matter how your heart is grieving if you keep on believing the dream that you wish will come true look what i found. over there, cinderella. wait a minute. one at a time, please. now, jaq, what's all the fuss about?
