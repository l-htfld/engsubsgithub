why are you holding back from such a man? is it the clumpy way he walks? what? or the grumpy way he talks? oh, no. or the pear shaped, square shaped weirdness of his feet? kristoff hey! and though we know he washes well he always ends up sort of smelly but you'll never meet a fella both who's as sensitive and sweet that's nice, but. both so, he's a bit of a fixer upper whoa, whoa, whoa. so, he's got a few flaws troll like his peculiar brain, dear troll his thing with the reindeer both that's a little outside of nature's laws this is not about me! so, he's a bit of a fixer upper but this we're certain of you can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love um. can we please just stop talking about this? we've got a real, actual problem, here. i'll say. so, tell me, dear. is it the way that he runs scared? or that he's socially impaired? or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods? i did not need to know that. are you holding back your fondness due to his unmanly blondness? or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods? he's just a bit of a fixer upper he's got a couple of bugs no, i don't! his isolation is confirmation of his desperation for healing hugs aw. so, he's a bit of a fixer upper but we know what to do the way to fix up this fixer upper is to fix him up with you both whoa! stop it, stop it, stop it! enough! she is engaged to someone else, okay? so, she's a bit of a fixer upper that's a minor thing her quote engagement is a flex arrangement and by the way, i don't see no ring so, she's a bit of a fixer upper hey! whoa, watch it! her brain's a bit betwixt get the fiance out of the way and the whole thing will be fixed we're not saying you can change him 'cause people don't really change we're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange people make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed but throw a little love their way throw a little love their way and you'll bring out their best true love brings out the best everyone's a bit of a fixer upper that's what it's all about father! sister! brother! we need each other to raise us up and round us out everyone's a bit of a fixer upper but when push comes to shove the only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is. true, true true, true true love! love, love, love love true love true do you, anna, take kristoff to be your trollfully wedded. wait, what?
