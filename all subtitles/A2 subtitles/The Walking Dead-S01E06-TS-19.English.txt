an extraordinary one. not that it matters in the end. take us in for eiv. vi enhanced internal view. what are those lights? jenner it's a person's life experiences, memories. it's everything. somewhere in all that organic wiring, all those ripples of light, is you the thing that makes you unique. and human. you don't make sense ever? those are synapses, electric impulses in the brain that carry all the messages. they determine everything a person says does or thinks from the moment of birth to the moment of death. death? that's what this is, a vigil? yes. or rather the playback of the vigil. this person died? who? jenner test subject . someone who was bitten and infected. and volunteered to have us record the process. vi, scan forward to the first event. vi scanning to first event. beeping what is that? it invades the brain like meningitis. the adrenal glands hemorrhage, the brain goes into shutdown, then the major organs. then death. everything you ever were or ever will be. gone. is that what happened to jim? yes. lori she lost somebody two days ago. her sister. i lost somebody too. i know how devastating it is. scan to the second event. vi scanning to second event. jenner the resurrection times vary wildly. we had reports of it happening in as little as three minutes. the longest we heard of was eight hours. in the case of this patient, it was two hours, one minute. seven seconds. it restarts the brain? no, just the brain stem. basically, it gets them up and moving. but they're not alive? you tell me. it's nothing like before. most of that brain is dark. jenner dark, lifeless, dead. the frontal lobe, the neocortex, the human part that doesn't come back. the you part. just a shell driven by mindless instinct. god. what was that? he shot his patient in the head. didn't you? jenner vi, power down the main screen and the workstations. vi powering down main screen and workstations. you have no idea what it is, do you? it could be microbial, viral, parasitic, fungal or the wrath of god? there is that. andrea somebody must know something. somebody somewhere. carol there are others, right? other facilities? there may be some. people like me. but you don't know? how can you not know? jenner everything went down. communications, directives all of it. i've been in the dark for almost a month. so it's not just here. there's nothing left anywhere? nothing? that's what you're really saying, right? jesus. man, i'm gonna get shit faced drunk again. dr. jenner, i know this has been taxing for you and i hate to ask one more question, but. that clock it's counting down. what happens at zero? the basement generators they run out of fuel. and then? vi, what happens when the power runs out? vi when the power runs out, facility wide decontamination will occur. beeps glenn decontamination what does that mean? shane i don't like the way jenner clammed up. the way he just wandered off like that. what's wrong with him? seriously, man, is he nuts, medicated or what? in there. beeps lights humming check that way. shane. chugging it's empty. sighs generator clacks vi emergency lighting on. what the hell is this? hey, you guys kill the lights? nah, it just went out. rick anything? t dog yeah, a lot of dead generators and more empty fuel drums than i can count. it can't be down to just that one. mom? something wrong? nothing. it's just. the air conditioning stopped. sighs, sniffles i did the best i could in the time that i had. i hope you'd be proud of that. we always think there's gonna be more time. power whirs down .then it runs out. carol why is the air off? and the lights in our room? daryl what's going on? why is everything turned off? energy use is being prioritized. dale air isn't a priority? and lights? it's not up to me. zone is shutting itself down. daryl hey! hey, what the hell does that mean? power whirs down hey, man, i'm talking to you. what do you mean it's shutting itself down? how can a building do anything? jenner you'd be surprised. rick? jenner, what's happening? the system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power. it's designed to keep the computers running to the last possible second. that started as we approached the half hour mark. right on schedule. it was the french. what? they were the last ones to hold out as far as i know. while our people were bolting out the doors and committing suicide in the hallways, they stayed in the labs till the end. they thought they were close to a solution. what happened? jenner the same thing that's happening here. no power grid. ran out of juice. the world runs on fossil fuel. i mean, how stupid is that? shane let me tell you rick to hell with it. i don't care. lori, grab our things. everybody, get your stuff. we're getting out of here now! oh, okay. alarm blaring what's that?

what happens in minutes? keyboard clacks what happens in minutes?! daryl come on! do you know what this place is?! we protected the public from very nasty stuff! weaponized smallpox! ebola strains that could wipe out half the country! stuff you don't want getting out! ever! in the event of a catastrophic power failure in a terrorist attack, for example hits are deployed to prevent any organisms from getting out. hits? vi, define. vi hits high impulse thermobaric fuel air explosives consist of a two stage aerosol ignition that produces a blast wave of significantly greater power and duration than any other known explosive except nuclear. the vacuum pressure effect ignites the oxygen at between , and , and is useful when the greatest loss of life and damage to structures is desired. it sets the air on fire. no pain. both crying jenner an end to sorrow, grief. regret. everything. open the damn door! out of my way! grunts t dog daryl! both pounding, grunting crying you should've left well enough alone. it would've been so much easier. lori easier for who?

what? you really said that? after all your big talk? i had to keep hope alive, didn't i? jenner there is no hope. there never was. there's always hope. maybe it won't be you, maybe not here, but somebody somewhere what part of everything is gone do you not understand? jenner listen to your friend. she gets it. this is what takes us down. this is our extinction event. crying continues carol this isn't right. you can't just keep us here. one tiny moment a millisecond. no pain. my daughter doesn't deserve to die like this. wouldn't it be kinder, more compassionate to just hold your loved ones and wait for the clock to run down? gun cocks shane, no! out of the way, rick! stay out of my way! open that door or i'm gonna blow your head off. do you hear me?! brother, brother, this is not the way you do this. we will never get out of here. shane, you listen to him. shane it's too late. he dies, we all yelling we all die! shane! shane! grunts panting are you done now?
