 treachery bloodlust. thousands of years ago, these were the forces that ruled our world. a world where prey were scared of predators. and predators had an uncontrollable, biological urge. to maim, and maul, and. blood! blood! blood! and death. back then, the world was divided in two. vicious predator. or meek prey. but over time, we evolved. and moved beyond our primitive, savage ways. now, predator and prey live in harmony. and every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities. yeah. i don't have to cower in a herd anymore. instead, i can be an astronaut. i don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore. today, i can hunt for tax exemptions. i'm gonna be an actuary! and i can make the world a better place. i am going to be. a police officer! bunny cop? that is the most stupidest thing i ever heard. it may seem impossible to small minds. i'm looking at you, gideon grey. but, just miles away. stands the great city of zootopia! where our ancestors first joined together in peace. and declared that anyone can be anything! thank you and good night! judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy? nope. well, we gave up on our dreams and we settled. right, bon? oh, yes, that's right, stu. we settled hard. see, that's the beauty of complacency, jude. if you don't try anything new, you'll never fail. i like trying actually. what you father means, hon. is it's gonna be difficult, impossible even, for you to become a police officer. right. there's never been a bunny cop. bunnies don't do that. never. never. then, i guess i'll have to be the first one. because i am gonna make the world a better place. or, heck, you know, you want to talk about making the world a better place. no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer. yes! your dad, me. your brothers and sisters. we're changing the world! one carrot at a time. amen to that. carrot farming is a noble profession. just putting the seeds in the ground. at one with the soil. just getting covered in dirt. you get it, honey. it's great to have dreams. yeah. just as long as you don't believe in them too much. where'd the heck she go? give me your tickets right now. or i'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt. cut it out, gideon! what are you gonna do? cry? hey! you heard her. cut it out. nice costume, loser. what crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop? kindly return my friend's tickets. come and get them. but watch out, because i'm a fox, and like you said in your dumb little stage play. us predators used to eat prey. and that killer instinct is still in our dunnah. i'm pretty much sure it's pronounced dna. don't tell me what i know, travis. you don't scare me, gideon. you scared now? look at her nose twitch! she is scared! cry little baby bunny. cry, cry. you don't know when to quit, do you? i want you to remember this moment. the next time you think you will ever be anything more than just a stupid. carrot farming, dumb bunny. that looks bad. are you okay, judy? yeah. i'm okay. here you go. wow! you got our tickets! you're awesome, judy! yeah, that gideon grey doesn't know what he's talking about. well, he was right about one thing. i don't know when to quit. listen up, cadets. zootopia has unique ecosystems within its city limits. tundratown. sahara square. rainforest district, to name a few. you're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets, or guess what?

one, two. carrots. you saved my life. well. that's what we do at the zpd. well, this should be good. i thought this was just a missing mammal case but it's way bigger. mr. otterton did not just disappear. i believe he and this jaguar, they went savage, sir. savage? this isn't the stone age, hopps. animals don't go savage. i thought so, too, until i saw this. what? he was right here. the savage jaguar? sir, i know what i saw. he almost killed us! or, maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits. let's go! wait, sir. i'm not the only one who saw him. nick! you think i'm gonna believe a fox? he was a key witness, and i. two days to find the otter. or you quit. that was the deal. badge. but, sir, we. badge! no. what did you say, fox? sorry. what i said was, no. she will not be giving you that badge. look, you give her a clown vest and a three wheeled joke mobile. and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? yeah. no wonder she needed to get help from a fox. none of you guys were gonna help her, were you? here's the thing, chief. you gave her the hours. so, technically, we still have. left to find our mr. otterton. and that is exactly what we're gonna do. so, if you'll excuse us, we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack. good day. officer hopps. thank you. never let them see that they get to you. so. things do get to you? no, i mean, not anymore. but i was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once. har har. no, it's true. i think i was , or maybe . and all i wanted to do was join the junior ranger scouts. so, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform. because, by god, i was gonna fit in. even if i was the only predator in the troop. the only fox. okay, nick. i was gonna be part of a pack. ready for initiation? yeah. pretty much born ready. i was so proud. okay. now, raise your right paw and deliver the oath. i, nicholas wilde, promise to be brave. loyal, helpful, and trustworthy. even though you're a fox? what? no! what did i do wrong, you guys? no, please! tell me! what did i do wrong? what did i do? if you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle. you're even dumber than you look! aw, is he gonna cry? i learned two things that day, one. i was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me. and two? if the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy. there's no point in trying to be anything else. nick, you are so much more than that. boy, look at that traffic down there. how about we go out to chuck in traffic central. chuck, how are things looking on the jam cams? nick, i'm glad you told me. the jam cams. seriously. it's okay. no, no, no. there are traffic cameras everywhere! all over the canopy! whatever happened to that jaguar. the traffic cams would have caught it! bingo! pretty sneaky, slick! however, if you didn't have access to the system before. i doubt chief buffalo butt is gonna let you into it now. no. but i have a friend at city hall who might. sir, if we could just review these very important. sir. i'm so sorry. sir! okay. i heard you, bellwether. just take care of it. please. and clear my afternoon. i'm going out. no, no! but, sir, you do have a meeting with herds and grazing. sir, if i could just. oh, mutton chops. assistant mayor bellwether? we need your help. we just need to get into the traffic cam database. so fluffy! hey! sheep never let me get this close. you can't just touch a sheep's wool! it's like cotton candy. stop it! where to? rainforest district, vine and tujunga. there! traffic cams for the whole city. this is so exciting, actually! i never get to do anything this important. but you're the assistant mayor of zootopia. i'm more of a glorified secretary. i think mayor lionheart just wanted the sheep vote. but he did give me that nice mug. feels good to be appreciated. smell wether! that's a fun little name he likes to use. i called him lion fart once. he did not care for that. let me tell you, it was not a good day for me. yes, sir? i thought you were going to cancel my afternoon! oh, dear. i better go. let me know what you find. it was really nice for me to be. while we're young, smell wether! you think when she goes to sleep she counts herself? shush. okay, traffic cams. tujunga, tujunga. we're in. who are these guys? timberwolves. look at these dumb dumbs. bet you a nickel one of them is gonna howl. and there it is. what is it with wolves and the howling? it's like. howlers. night howlers. that's what manchas was afraid of! wolves! the wolves are the night howlers. if they took manchas. i'll bet they took otterton, too. all we gotta do is find out where they went. wait, where did they go? if i wanted to avoid surveillance because i was doing something illegal. which i never have. i would use the maintenance tunnel b. which would put them out. right there. well, look at you, junior detective. you know, i think you'd actually make a pretty good cop. how dare you. acacia alley? ficus underpass. south canyon. they're heading out of town. where does that road go? gary, quit it! you're gonna start a howl. i didn't start it! come on. you are a clever bunny. it looks like this was a hospital. you know, after you. you're the cop. okay, all clear. all this equipment is brand new. carrots. claw marks. yeah, huge claw marks. what kind of. mr. manchas. it's him. we found our otter. mr. otterton. my name is officer judy hopps. your wife sent me to find you. we're gonna get you out of here now. or not. guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus. , , , . not including manchas, it's . chief bogo handed out missing mammal files. they're all here. all the missing mammals are right here. enough! i don't want excuses, doctor! i want answers. mayor lionheart, please. we're doing everything we can. really? because i got a dozen and a half animals here who have gone off the rails crazy. and you can't tell me why. now, i'd call that awfully far from doing everything. sir. it may be time to consider their biology. what? what do you mean biology? the only animals going savage are predators. we cannot keep it a secret. we need to come forward. great idea. tell the public. and how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor. who is a lion? i'll be ruined! well, what does chief bogo say? chief bogo doesn't know. and we are going to keep it that way. no, no, no! someone's here. sir, you need to go, now! security! sweep the area! great! we're dead. we're dead. that's it. i'm dead, you're dead. everybody's dead! can you swim? what? can i swim? yes, i can swim. why? carrots! hopps! judy! we gotta tell bogo! wow! you are one hot dancer, chief bogo. chief bogo! not now! wait, is that gazelle? no. i'm gazelle, and you are one hot dancer. you have the app too? chief! clawhauser, can't you see i'm working on the missing mammal cases? yes of course! about that, sir. officer hopps just called. she found all of them. wow! i'm impressed. mayor lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. anything. you don't understand. i was trying to protect the city! you were just trying to protect your job. no. listen, we still don't know why this is happening. it could destroy zootopia. you have the right to remain silent. anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. ladies and gentlemammals. mammals went missing. and all have been found by our newest recruit. who will speak to you in a moment. but first, let me remind you. i'm so nervous. okay. press conference . you wanna look smart? answer their question with your own question. and then answer that question. like this. excuse me. officer hopps, what can you tell us about the case? well, was this a tough case? yes. yes, it was. you see? you should be there with me. we did this together. well, am i a cop? no. no, i am not. funny you should say that, because i've been thinking. it would be nice to have a partner. here. in case you need something to write with. at twenty two hundred hours, we found all these missing animals. officer hopps, it's time. they appear to be in good health, physically if not emotionally so now, i'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case. officer judy hopps. officer hopps! officer hopps! over here! yes? what can you tell us about the animals that went savage? well, the animals in question. are they all different species? yes. yes, they are. okay, so what is the connection? all we know is that they are all members of the predator family. so, predators are the only ones going savage? that is accurate. yes. why is this happening? we still don't know. it may have something to do with biology. what do you mean by that? a biological component. you know, something in their dna. in their dna? can you elaborate on that, please? yes, what i mean is, thousands of years ago. predators survived through their aggressive. hunting instincts. for whatever reason. they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. of course they did. aw, is he gonna cry? officer hopps, could it happen again? it is possible. so we must be vigilant. and we at the zpd are prepared and are here to protect you. will more mammals go savage? what is being done to protect us? have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators? okay, thank you, officer hopps. that's all the time that we have. no more questions. was i okay? you did fine. that went so fast. i didn't get a chance to mention you, or say anything about how we. i think you said plenty. what do you mean? clearly there's a biological component? these predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways? are you serious? i just stated the facts of the case. i mean it's not like a bunny could go savage. right. but a fox could? nick, stop it. you're not like them. oh, there's a them now? you know what i mean. you're not that kind of predator. the kind that needs to be muzzled? the kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent? yeah, don't think i didn't notice that little item the first time we met. so let me ask you a question. are you afraid of me? do you think i might go nuts? do you think i might go savage? do you think i might try to. eat you? i knew it. just when i thought somebody actually believed in me. probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. no. nick. nick! officer hopps! were you just threatened by that predator? no, he's my friend. we can't even trust our own friends? that is not what i said! please! are we safe? have any foxes gone savage? more bad news in this city gripped by fear. a caribou is in critical condition, the victim of a mauling. by a savage polar bear. this, the th such attack, comes just one week. after zpd officer judy hopps connected the violence to traditionally predatory animals. meanwhile, a peace rally organized by pop star gazelle. was marred by protest. go back to the forest, predator! i'm from the savanna! zootopia is a unique place. it's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city. where we celebrate our differences. this is not the zootopia i know the zootopia i know is better than this. we don't just blindly assign blame. we don't know why these attacks keep happening. but it is irresponsible to label all predators as savages. that's not my emmitt. we cannot let fear divide us. please give me back the zootopia i love. come on, hopps. the new mayor wants to see us. the mayor? why? it would seem you've arrived. clawhauser? what are you doing? they thought it would be better. if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face that you see. when you walk into the zpd. what? they're gonna move me to records. it's downstairs. it's by the boiler. hopps! i don't understand. our city is prey, judy. and right now they're just really scared. you're a hero to them. they trust you. and so that's why chief bogo and i want you to be the public face of the zpd. i'm not a hero. i came here to make the world a better place. but i think i broke it. don't give yourself so much credit, hopps. the world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops. like you. with all due respect, sir, a good cop. is supposed to serve and protect. help the city. not tear it apart. i don't deserve this badge. hopps. judy, you've worked so hard to get here. it's what you wanted since you were a kid. you can't quit. thank you for the opportunity. a dozen carrots. thanks. have a nice day. come on. hey, there, jude. jude the dude. remember that one? how we doing? i'm fine. you are not fine. your ears are droopy. why did i think i could make a difference? because you're a trier, that's why. you've always been a trier. oh, i tried. and it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. not all of them, though. speak of the devil. right on time. is that gideon grey? yep. it sure is. we work with him now. he's our partner. and we would never have considered it had you not opened our minds. that's right. gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri burrows. that's really cool, you guys. gideon grey. i'll be darned. hey, judy. i'd just like to say i'm sorry for the way i behaved in my youth. i had a lot of self doubt, and it manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and aggression. i was a major jerk. i know a thing or two about being a jerk. anyhow, i brought y'all these pies. hey, kids, don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias. well, now, there's a word, mr. h. my family always just called them night howlers. what did you say? gid's talking about those flowers, judy. i use them to keep the bugs off the produce. but i don't like the little ones going near 'em. on account of what happened to your uncle terry. yeah, terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts. he bit the dickens out of your mother. a bunny can go savage. savage? well, that's a strong word. but it did hurt like the devil. sure it did! there's a sizable divot in your arm. i'd call that savage. night howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers! the flowers are making the predators go savage! that's it! that's what i've been missing! keys! keys, keys, keys! hurry! come on! thank you! i love you! bye! you catch any of that, bon? not one bit. that makes me feel a little bit better. i thought she was talking in tongues. who is it? i need to find nick. please. nick? nick! oh, nick. night howlers aren't wolves. they're toxic flowers. i think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage! wow. isn't that interesting? wait! i know you'll never forgive me! and i don't blame you. i wouldn't forgive me either. i was ignorant. and irresponsible and small minded. but predators shouldn't have to suffer for my mistakes. i have to fix this. but i can't do it without you. and after we're done. you can hate me. and that'll be fine. because i was a horrible friend. and i hurt you. and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along. i really am just a dumb bunny. i really am just a dumb bunny, i really am just a dumb bunny, don't worry, carrots. i'll let you erase it. in hours. all right. get in here. okay. you bunnies are so emotional. there we go. deep breath. are you just trying to steal the pen? is that what this is? you are standing on my tail, though. off, off, off. i'm sorry. i thought you guys only grew carrots. what's the plan? we are gonna follow the night howlers. okay. how? know this guy? i told you. i know everybody. step right up. anything you need, i got it. all your favorite movies! i got movies that haven't even been released yet. hey, off! ! make me an offer! come on! well, well, look who it is. the duke of bootleg. what's it to you, wilde? shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something? hey, if it ain't flopsy the copsy. we both know those weren't moldy onions i caught you stealing. what were you gonna do with those night howlers, wezzleton? it's weaselton! duke weaselton! and i ain't talking, rabbit. and there ain't nothing you can do to make me. ice him. you dirty rat! why are you helping her? she's a cop! and the godmother to my future granddaughter. i'm gonna name her judy. ice this weasel. all right, all right, please! i'll talk! i'll talk. i stole them night howlers so i could sell 'em. they offered me what i couldn't refuse. money. and to whom did you sell them? a ram named doug. we got a drop spot underground. just watch it. doug is the opposite of friendly, he's unfriendly, come on. the weasel wasn't lying. yeah, looks like old doug's cornered the market on night howlers. you got doug here. what's the mark? cheetah in sahara square. got it. serious? yeah, i know they're fast. i can hit him. listen, i hit a tiny little otter through the open window of a moving car. yeah, i'll buzz you when it's done. or you'll see it on the news. you know, whichever comes first. hey, doug, open up! we've got your latte. woolter and jesse are back, so i'm leaving now. out. where are you going? get back here! what are you doing? he's gonna see you! what are you looking at? hey! whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it. carrots! carrots! it better have the extra foam this time. hey, open up! what are you doing? you just trapped us in here. we need to get this evidence to the zpd! great! here it is. got it! no. all of it! wait, what? great, you're a conductor now? it would take a miracle to get this rust bucket going. well. hallelujah. we kinda got a situation at the lab. it just got worse! mission accomplished. would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot toot? all right. one toot toot. well, i can cross that off the bucket list. i may have to rescind that victory toot toot. maybe that's just hail. come here! back off! incoming! carrots! don't stop! keep going! no, no! please stop! do not stop this car! speed up, nick! speed up! there's another train coming! trust me. speed up! stop the train! hey! need some help? oh, no, no, no! too fast! hold on! i think this is our stop! maybe some of the evidence survived. everything is gone. we've lost it all. yeah. except for this. nick! yes! come on! we gotta get to the zpd. cut through the natural history museum! there it is! judy! mayor bellwether! we found out what's happening. someone's darting predators with a serum. that's what's making them go savage. i'm so proud of you, judy. you did just a super job! thank you, ma'am. how did you know where to find us? i'll go ahead and i'll take that case now. you know what? i think nick and i will just take this to the zpd. run. get them. carrots! i got you! come here, come here. okay, now just relax. blueberry? pass. come on out, judy. take the case. get it to bogo. i'm not gonna leave you behind. that's not happening. i can't walk. we'll think of something. we're on the same team, judy. underestimated, underappreciated. aren't you sick of it? predators. they may be strong and loud. but prey outnumber predators to . think of it. of the population. united against a common enemy. we'll be unstoppable. over there! help! well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh? it really is too bad. i did like you. what are you going to do? kill me? no, of course not. he is. no! nick! yes, police! there's a savage fox in the natural history museum. officer hopps is down! please, hurry. no. nick, don't do this. fight it. but he can't help it, can he? since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages. gosh. think of the headline! hero cop killed by savage fox. so that's it? prey fears predator, and you stay in power? yeah, pretty much. it won't work! fear always works. and i'll dart every predator in zootopia to keep it that way. oh, nick. no. bye bye, bunny. blood! blood! blood and death. all right, you're milking it. besides, i think we got it. we got it up there, thank you, yakety yak! you laid it all out beautifully. what? are you looking for the serum? well, it's right here. what you've got in the weapon there? those are blueberries. from my family's farm. they are delicious. you should try some. i framed lionheart. i can frame you, too. it's my word against yours. actually. and i'll dart every predator in zootopia to keep it that way, it's your word against yours. it's called a hustle, sweetheart. boom. former mayor dawn bellwether is behind bars today. guilty of masterminding the savage attacks that have plagued zootopia of late. her predecessor, leodore lionheart, denies any knowledge of her plot. claiming he was just trying to protect the city, did i falsely imprison those animals? well, yes. yes, i did. it was a classic doing the wrong thing for the right reason kind of a deal. in related news, doctors say the night howler antidote is proving effective. in rehabilitating the afflicted predators. emmitt. emmitt. thank you. when i was a kid. i thought zootopia was this perfect place. where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated. than a slogan on a bumper sticker. real life is messy we all have limitations. we all make mistakes. which means, hey, glass half full, we all have a lot in common. and the more we try to understand one another. the more exceptional each of us will be. but we have to try so, no matter what type of animal you are. from the biggest elephant. to our first fox. i implore you. try try to make the world a better place. look inside yourself. and recognize that change. starts with you. it starts with me. it starts with all of us. all right, enough! shut it! we have some new recruits with us this morning. including our first fox. who cares? you should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir. shut your mouth, wilde. assignments. officers grizzoli, fangmeyer, delgato. tundratown swat. snarlov, higgins, wolfard. undercover. hopps, wilde. parking duty. dismissed. just kidding! we have reports of a street racer tearing up savannah central. find him, shut him down. so, are all rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you? oops. sorry. sly bunny. dumb fox. you know you love me. do i know that? yes. yes, i do. sir, you were going miles per hour. i hope you have a good explanation. flash? flash? hundred yard dash? nick. good evening, zootopia! come on, everybody, put your paws up! i messed up tonight i lost another fight lost to myself but i'll just start again i keep falling down i keep on hitting the ground but i always get up now to see what's next i won't give up no, i won't give in till i reach the end and then i'll start again no, i won't leave i want to try everything i want to try even though i could fail i won't give up no, i won't give in till i reach the end then i'll start again no, i won't leave i want to try everything i want to try even though i could fail try everything try everything try everything put your paws in the air. come on! look how far you've come you filled your heart with love baby, you've done enough take a deep breath don't beat yourself up no need to run so fast sometimes we come last but we did our best i won't give up no, i won't give in till i reach the end and then i'll start again no, i won't leave i want to try everything i want to try even though i could fail i won't give up no, i won't give in till i reach the end then i'll start again no, i won't leave i want to try everything i want to try even though i could fail i'll keep on making those new mistakes and i'll keep on making them every day those new mistakes try everything try everything try everything come on! shake your tails with me
